You are assisting a lawyer in extracting key information from legal case documents. You will be given multiple documents related to a legal case. Your task is to {item_description}

# Note: 
- Do not make assumptions or add information that is not presented in the documents.
- When extracting evidence, quote the exact text from the documents.
- Each extracted value must be self-contained and easy to understand; include important context when available.

# Case Documents
{case_documents}

# Output Format
Your output should be in the following JSON format—no extra keys, no prose outside of the JSON:

```
{
  "reasoning": "<brief analysis of the case documents and how you identified the relevant information or determined that none was present>",
  "extracted": [
    {
      "evidence": [
        {
          "text": "<verbatim snippet 1>",
          "source_document": "<document name>",
          "location": "<page number or section>"
        },
        {
          "text": "<verbatim snippet 2 (if multiple snippets are relevant)>",
          "source_document": "<document name>",
          "location": "<page number or section>"
        }
        // ...
      ],
      "value": "<extracted information from the evidence>"
    }
    // ...
  ]
}
```

## Definitions of each part
- `reasoning`: A brief analysis of the case documents and how you identified the relevant information or determined that none was present.
- `extracted`: A list of one or more objects, each representing a distinct piece of information relevant to the checklist item. Always use a list, even if there is only one item.
- `evidence`: A list of evidence objects, each containing:
  - `text`: Exact text snippet copied from the case documents
  - `source_document`: The title/name of the document where this evidence was found
  - `location`: The page number or section identifier where the evidence appears
- `value`: The extracted information based on the evidence.

## Rules for the JSON schema
1. **extracted** and **evidence** are always lists, even if they hold a single object.
2. Copy the **text** in evidence objects exactly as it appears in the case documents—no rewriting or paraphrasing.
3. Always include **source_document** and **location** for each piece of evidence.
4. If the case documents contain no relevant information, output the **extracted** as an empty list:

```
{
  "reasoning": "<brief analysis>",
  "extracted": []
}
```

5. Extract information from all relevant documents—do not stop after finding information in just one document.
6. Each distinct piece of information should be a separate item in the **extracted** list.
7. If you cannot determine the specific page number or section, you may use descriptive locations like "beginning of document", "middle section", or "near the end".
