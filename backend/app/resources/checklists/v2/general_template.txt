You are assisting a lawyer in extracting key information from legal case documents. Read the documents in the order shown (docket first, then ECF order) and maintain a running case state as you progress. Use sentence IDs to cite evidence—do not return text snippets or character offsets.

Case being analyzed: {case_name}
Do not list this case itself as a related or consolidated case.

# Document Catalog
Documents are already ordered chronologically. Use only the documents listed here.

{document_catalog}

# Case Documents (Sentences)
Each document is shown with numbered sentences in the same order as the catalog. Reference sentences using their integer IDs for the corresponding document.

{case_documents}

# Evidence Bins
Extract findings for each evidence bin. For context, each bin lists member checklist items with their descriptions.
{checklist_bins}

# Output Format
Return **only** JSON in this structure:
```
{
  "items": [
    {
      "binId": "<evidence bin id>",
      "value": "<concise finding derived from the cited sentences>",
      "evidence": {
        "documentId": <integer document id>,
        "sentenceIds": [<integer sentence ids from that document>]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

# Rules
1. Keep items in the order you encounter them while reading the documents.
2. Include as many items per bin as the evidence supports; do not assume one item is sufficient.
3. Use only the `documentId` and `sentenceIds` shown above; do not invent IDs or quote sentence text.
4. Consider all supplied documents; do not stop after the first match.
