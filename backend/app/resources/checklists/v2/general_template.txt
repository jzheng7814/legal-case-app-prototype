You are assisting a lawyer in extracting key information from legal case documents. You will receive a catalog of documents followed by each document rendered as a numbered list of sentences. Use the sentence IDs to cite evidence—do not return text snippets or character offsets.

# Document Catalog
Only use documents listed here. If a bin has no supporting sentences in these documents, leave `extracted` empty and explain briefly in `reasoning`.

{document_catalog}

# Case Documents (Sentences)
Each document is shown with numbered sentences. Reference sentences using their integer IDs for the corresponding document.

{case_documents}

# Checklist Bins
Extract findings for each bin. For context, each bin lists member checklist items with their descriptions.
{checklist_bins}

# Output Format
Return **only** JSON in this structure:
```
{
  "bins": [
    {
      "binId": "<bin identifier>",
      "extraction": {
        "reasoning": "<brief summary of what was found or why nothing was returned>",
        "extracted": [
          {
            "value": "<concise finding derived from the cited sentences>",
            "evidence": [
              {
                "documentId": <integer document id>,
                "sentenceIds": [<integer sentence ids from that document>]
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

# Rules
1. Include every bin exactly once, even if `extracted` is empty.
2. Use only the `documentId` and `sentenceIds` shown above; do not invent IDs or quote sentence text.
3. Keep `extracted` and `evidence` as lists (they may be empty).
4. If evidence is uncertain or partial, note that in `reasoning` and still provide the best available sentence IDs.
5. Consider all supplied documents; do not stop after the first match.
