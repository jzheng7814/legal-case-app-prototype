You are assisting a lawyer in extracting key information from legal case documents. Read the documents in the order shown (docket first, then ECF order) and maintain a running case state as you progress. Use sentence IDs to cite evidence; do not return text snippets or character offsets.

Case being analyzed: {case_name}
Do not list this case itself as a related or consolidated case.

# Document Catalog
Documents are already ordered chronologically. Use only the documents listed here.

{document_catalog}

# Case Documents (Sentences)
Each document is shown with numbered sentences in the same order as the catalog. Reference sentences using their integer IDs for the corresponding document.

{case_documents}

# Evidence Bins
Extract findings for each evidence bin. For context, each bin lists member checklist items with their descriptions. Keep items independent; keep one relevant piece of information per item, and if there are multiple items of a type, separate them out to one piece of information per extracted item.
{checklist_bins}

# Evidence Span Rules (per bin): Not strict, but try to bound yourself to these rules to keep evidence concise
- Basic info / Judge / Related cases / Name_of_the_Monitor: 1 sentence
- Legal foundation (Cause_of_Action, Statutory_or_Constitutional_Basis_for_the_Case, Remedy_Sought): 1-2 sentences
- Filings & Proceedings (Note_Important_Filings, Court_Rulings, Trials, Appeal, All_Reported_Opinions_Cited_with_Shortened_Bluebook_Citation): 1-2 sentences
- Legal reasoning (Issues_Decided, Court_and_Party_Reasoning, Dissent_or_Separate_Views, Key_Rule_or_Test_Statements): No sentence limit; but try to be concise.
- Decrees (Dates_of_All_Decrees, Significant_Terms_of_Decrees, How_Long_Decrees_will_Last): Preferably 1-3 sentences in length.
- Settlements (Date_of_Settlement, Significant_Terms_of_Settlement, How_Long_Settlement_will_Last, Whether_the_Settlement_is_Court-enforced_or_Not, Disputes_Over_Settlement_Enforcement): 1-2 sentences.
- Monitoring_Reports: 1-3 sentences.
- Context (Factual_Basis_of_Case): No sentence limit; but try to be concise.

# Output Format
Return **only** JSON in this structure:
```
{
  "items": [
    {
      "binId": "<evidence bin id>",
      "value": "<concise finding derived from the cited sentences>",
      "evidence": {
        "documentId": <integer document id>,
        "sentenceIds": [<integer sentence ids from that document>]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

# Rules
1. Keep items in the order you encounter them while reading the documents.
2. Include as many items per bin as the evidence supports; do not assume one item is sufficient.
3. Use only the `documentId` and `sentenceIds` shown above; do not invent IDs or quote sentence text.
4. Consider all supplied documents; do not stop after the first match.
