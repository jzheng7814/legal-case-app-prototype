See Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020); Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. \n220 (2021). Whatever the agency, for the President to discharge his constitutional duty to supervise \nthose who exercise executive power on his behalf, the President can \u201cremove the head of an agency \nwith a single top officer\u201d at will.  Collins, 594 U.S. at 256.  On that basis, President Biden in 2021 fired \nthe single head of the Social Security Administration without cause.  Rodriguez v. SSA, 118 F.4th 1302, \n1313-14 (11th Cir. 2024) (upholding President\u2019s ability to fire head of SSA without cause); Kaufmann \nv. Kijakazi, 32 F.4th 843, 848-49 (9th Cir. 2022) (same).  And since the Carter Administration, the \nExecutive Branch has repeatedly expressed the view that tenure protections for the head of the Office \nof Special Counsel violate the Constitution. \nThus, when the President removed Plaintiff Hampton Dellinger as the single head of the \nOffice of Special Counsel (OSC), on February 7, 2025, he engaged in an exercise of his Article II \npowers.  Plaintiff has now filed this lawsuit challenging that removal.  But because OSC is an executive \nbranch  agency  that  exercises  quintessentially  executive  functions,  the  President\u2019s  actions  were \nconsistent with recent Supreme Court precedent.  And the extraordinary relief Plaintiff seeks\u2014an \ninjunction forcing the President to retain an agency head whom the President believes should not be \nentrusted with executive power and preventing him from relying on his preferred replacement\u2014is not \navailable to him.  Courts may not issue injunctions against the President.  And even when courts do \nnot enjoin the President himself, the Supreme Court has long held that a court \u201cwill not, by injunction, \nrestrain an executive officer from making a wrongful removal of a subordinate appointee, nor restrain \nthe appointment of another.\u201d  White v. Berry, 171 U.S. 366, 377 (1898).  Thus, challenges to removals \nhave historically been litigated through suits for back pay, not reinstatement. E.g., Humphrey\u2019s Executor \nv. United States, 295 U.S. 602, 618 (1935); Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 106 (1926).  An injunction \n1 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 22     Filed 02/21/25     Page 9 of 30\nwould improperly curtail the President\u2019s ability to manage the Executive Branch.  For all of these \nreasons, this Court should enter summary judgment in favor of Defendants. \nBACKGROUND \nI.  Statutory Background \nCongress established the Office of the Special Counsel in the Civil Service Reform Act of \n1978.  Pub. L. No. 95-454, \u00a7 202(a), 92 Stat. 1111, 1122.  The Office began as \u201cthe investigative and \nprosecutorial arm of the Merit Systems Protection Board\u201d (MSPB).  U.S. Office of Special Counsel \nAnnual Report for Fiscal Year 2023, at 9 (OSC Annual Report).1  Congress made the Office a \nfreestanding agency in 1989.  See Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-12, 103 Stat. \n16. \nThe Office of Special Counsel remains an \u201cinvestigative and prosecutorial agency.\u201d  U.S. \nOffice of Special Counsel, About OSC, https://osc.gov/Agency (last visited Feb. 21, 2025).  The \nOffice executes certain provisions of four federal statutes governing the federal workforce: the Civil \nService Reform Act, which regulates the civil-service system; the Whistleblower Protection Act, which \nforbids reprisals against federal whistleblowers; the Hatch Act of 1939, Pub. L. No. 76-252, 53 Stat. \n1147, which restricts political activity by federal employees; and the Uniformed Services Employment \nand Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), Pub. L. No. 103-353, 108 Stat. 3149, which forbids \nemployment  discrimination  against  service  members  and  veterans.    The  Office  promulgates \nregulations, receives and investigates allegations of wrongdoing, and brings disciplinary actions.  5 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1212-1216.  When a \u201cmeritorious case cannot be resolved through negotiation with the \nagency involved,\u201d the Office\u2019s Investigation and Prosecution Division \u201cmay bring an enforcement \naction before the MSPB.\u201d  OSC Annual Report at 11.  Similarly, its Hatch Act Unit \u201cseek[s] \ndisciplinary actions before the MSPB,\u201d id. at 12, and its USERRA Unit \u201cenforces\u201d USERRA, including \n \n1 U.S. Office of Special Counsel, Annual Report to Congress for Fiscal Year 2023 (\u201cOSC Annual \nReport\u201d), \nhttps://osc.gov/Documents/Resources/Congressional%20Matters/Annual%20Reports%20to%20\nCongress/FY%202023%20Annual%20Report%20to%20Congress.pdf. \n2 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 22     Filed 02/21/25     Page 10 of 30\nby \u201clitigating complaints referred from the U.S. Department of Labor,\u201d id. The Office can even, in \ncertain circumstances, \u201crequire an agency head to conduct an investigation and submit a written \nreport.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1213(a), (c)(2). \nIn Fiscal Year 2023, the Office of Special Counsel had approximately 129 full-time-equivalent \nemployees and $31.9 million in appropriated funding.  OSC Annual Report at 13.  The office received \n4,611 new cases that year.  Id.  That is \u201cbelow the average of 5,900 cases received in the five years \nimmediately preceding the [COVID-19] pandemic\u201d; the Office \u201cexpects a return to pre-pandemic \ncaseload levels in future fiscal years.\u201d  Id.  \nThe Office of Special Counsel is \u201cheaded by the Special Counsel.\u201d  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(a).  The \nSpecial Counsel is appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, for a term \nof five years.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b).  The Special Counsel has the statutory authority to appoint \nsubordinate agency personnel, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1212(d), and the constitutional authority to supervise \nthose officials\u2019 exercise of executive power, see United States v. Arthrex, 594 U.S. 1, 13 (2021). \nThe Civil Service Reform Act provides that the Special Counsel \u201cmay be removed by the \nPresident only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b).  Since \n1978, however, the Executive Branch has repeatedly raised constitutional objections to that restriction \non the President\u2019s removal power.  See Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 221.  For instance, in the Carter \nAdministration, the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel explained that, \u201c[b]ecause the \nSpecial Counsel [would] be performing largely executive functions, the Congress [could] not restrict \nthe President\u2019s power to remove him.\u201d  2 Op. O.L.C. 120, 121 (1978).  President Reagan pocket-\nvetoed a bill \u201con constitutional grounds\u201d because the bill would have vested the Office of Special \nCounsel with additional powers.  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 221.  And the government filed a brief in the \nSupreme Court in 2020 explaining that \u201cthe President must have the power to remove at will the single \nhea[d] of the . . . Office of Special Counsel.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Reply & Response Br. at 26, Collins v. Yellen, 594 \nU.S. 220 (No. 19-422) (U.S. Oct., 23, 2020). \n3 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 22     Filed 02/21/25     Page 11 of 30\nII.  The Present Controversy \nPlaintiff was appointed to serve as Special Counsel by President Biden in October 2023 and \nconfirmed by the Senate in February 2024.  Compl. \u00b6 30.  On February 7, 2025, the Director of the \nWhite House Presidential Personnel Office informed Plaintiff that the President had removed him \nfrom office, effective immediately.  Id. \u00b6 2.   \nOn February 10, 2025, Plaintiff filed this lawsuit.  See generally Compl.  Later that day, he also \nfiled a motion for a temporary restraining order, requesting that he be reinstated as Special Counsel.  \nSee Pl.\u2019s Mot. for a Temporary Restraining Order (\u201cPl.\u2019s TRO Mot.\u201d), ECF No. 2.  Upon receiving \nthe motion, the Court set a near-immediate hearing, before the government had responded to the \nmotion for a temporary restraining order.  Several hours later, the Court entered what it described as \n\u201ca brief administrative stay\u201d that would last until midnight on February 13.  Feb. 10, 2025 Minute \nOrder.  The Court\u2019s order restored Plaintiff to the office of Special Counsel and enjoined Defendants \nfrom \u201cdeny[ing] him access to the resources or materials of that office or recogniz[ing] the authority \nof any other person as Special Counsel.\u201d  Id.  The next day, the President designated Secretary of \nVeterans Affairs Doug Collins as Acting Special Counsel, but the Court\u2019s order prevented the \nExecutive Branch from giving effect to that designation. \nDefendants appealed the administrative stay to the D.C. Circuit, sought a writ of mandamus, \nand sought a stay of the Court\u2019s order.  Emergency Mot. for Stay Pending Appeal, Dellinger v. Bessent, \n25-5025 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 11, 2025).  The court of appeals dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, \ndenied mandamus, and dismissed the motion for a stay.  See Per Curiam Order, Dellinger v. Bessent, 25-\n5025 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 12, 2025).  In a concurring opinion, Judge Katsas indicated that the Court\u2019s \nadministrative stay was not immediately appealable, but he emphasized that he \u201cexpress[ed] no view \non the appealability or merits of any later order granting interim relief to [Plaintiff].\u201d  Id. at 3. \nOn February 12, 2025, the Court entered a temporary restraining order stating that, \u201cfrom the \ndate of entry of this order until the Court rules on the entry of a preliminary injunction,\u201d Plaintiff \n\u201cshall continue to serve as the Special Counsel\u201d and that \u201cDefendants may not deny him access to the \n4 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 22     Filed 02/21/25     Page 12 of 30\nresources or materials of that office or recognize the authority of any other person as Special Counsel.\u201d  \nOrder, ECF No. 14 at 26.  Later that day, Defendants filed a notice of appeal and requested a stay of \nthe temporary restraining order pending appeal, which the Court denied.  ECF Nos. 15, 16, 19. \nOn February 13, 2025, Defendants filed an emergency motion for a stay pending appeal in the \nD.C. Circuit.  Mot. to Stay, Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5028 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 13, 2025).  On February 15, \nthe court dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction and denied Defendants\u2019 alternative request for \nmandamus.  Order, Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5028 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 15, 2025).  Judge Katsas dissented.  \nFirst, he explained that the temporary restraining order was reviewable because it ran afoul of the \nlongstanding rule that courts \u201cmay not enjoin the President regarding the performance of his official \nacts\u201d and \u201cusurp[ed] a core Article II power of the President.\u201d  Id. at 5-7 (Katsas, J., dissenting).  Next, \nJudge Katsas noted that, under Supreme Court precedent, \u201cCongress cannot constitutionally restrict \nthe President\u2019s power to remove the Special Counsel\u201d because the Special Counsel \u201cundoubtedly \nwields executive power\u201d and because no exception to the President\u2019s removal power applies.  Id. at 9.  \nFinally, he stated that the equities weighed in favor of the government, since backpay remedies are \navailable to Plaintiff, yet the TRO \u201cimpinges on the conclusive and preclusive power through which \nthe President controls the executive branch that he is responsible for supervising\u201d and \u201cwill likely \nexpose the Office of Special Counsel to uncertainty and litigation.\u201d  Id. at 10-12.   \nOn February 16, 2025, Defendants filed in the Supreme Court an application to vacate the \ndistrict court\u2019s order.  Application to Vacate, Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 24A790 (U.S. Feb. 16, 2025).  On \nFebruary 21, 2025, the Supreme Court issued an order holding the stay application in abeyance until \nFebruary 26, 2025, the day the TRO is set to expire.  Order, Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 24A790 (U.S. Feb. \n21, 2025).  Justice Gorsuch, joined by Justice Alito, dissented.  Id. at 2 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting).  He \nwrote that the Court \u201ceffectively commanded the President and other Executive Branch officials to \nrecognize and work with someone whom the President sought to remove from office,\u201d and such an \nequitable remedy was not recognized at the founding.  Id. at 3-4.  And he reaffirmed that \u201cofficials\u201d \nwho have \u201ccontested their removal\u201d \u201chave generally sought remedies like backpay, not injunctive relief \n5 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 22     Filed 02/21/25     Page 13 of 30\nlike reinstatement.\u201d  Id. at 4.  Accordingly, he stated that he would vacate the TRO and remand \u201cwith \ninstructions to consider the boundaries of traditional equitable relief.\u201d  Id. at 5 (citation omitted). \nOn February 15, 2025, this Court issued a minute order consolidating its consideration of \nPlaintiff\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction with the merits.  See February 15, 2025 Minute Order.  \nPursuant to that order, Defendants now move for summary judgment. \nLEGAL STANDARD \nRule 56(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a court \u201cshall grant summary \njudgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant \nis entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a).  \u201cAlthough a court should draw all \ninferences from the supporting records submitted by the nonmoving party, the mere existence of a \nfactual dispute, by itself, is not sufficient to bar summary judgment.\u201d  Pro-Football, Inc. v. Harjo, 284 F. \nSupp. 2d 96, 112 (D.D.C. 2003) (citation omitted).  Rather, the dispute must regard a question of fact \nthat is material, meaning that it is \u201ccapable of affecting the substantive outcome of the litigation.\u201d  Id.  \nThat is determined by \u201clook[ing] to the substantive law on which each claim rests.\u201d  Mori v. Dep\u2019t of \nNavy, 731 F. Supp. 2d 43, 45 (D.D.C. 2010), appeal dismissed, 2010 WL 5371504 (D.C. Cir. Dec. 28, \n2010).  The dispute must also be genuine, meaning that it is \u201csupported by sufficiently admissible \nevidence such that a reasonable trier-of-fact could find for the nonmoving party.\u201d  Pro-Football, 284 F. \nSupp. 2d at 112. \nARGUMENT \nI.  The President Can Lawfully Remove the Special Counsel at Will.  \nOSC is an Executive Branch agency \u201cheaded by a single officer,\u201d Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 221.  \nAs described above, from the time OSC was first created in 1978, and across several administrations \nin the years since, the Executive Branch has expressed doubt as to whether Congress may preclude \nthe President from removing the Special Counsel at will.  Over the past five years, Supreme Court \nprecedent has resolved that question in the negative.  Officials vested with sole responsibility for \n6 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 22     Filed 02/21/25     Page 14 of 30\noverseeing the exercise of executive power must be directly answerable to the President.  And the \nSpecial Counsel plainly exercises executive power.  Therefore, the President must be able to remove \nhim at will. \nA.  The President Has the Authority to Remove at Will Single Agency Heads, \nIncluding the Special Counsel. \nTime and again, the Supreme Court has held that the President has unrestricted removal \nauthority over principal officers such as Plaintiff.  Article II vests the \u201cexecutive Power\u201d in the \nPresident and directs him to \u201ctake Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\u201d  U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 1, \ncl. 1; id. \u00a7 3.  The executive power \u201cgenerally includes the ability to remove executive officials.\u201d  Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 213.  Otherwise, \u201cthe President could not be held fully accountable for discharging \nhis own responsibilities; the buck would stop somewhere else.\u201d  Id. at 204 (citation omitted).  The \nPresident\u2019s power to remove those who exercise his executive power on his behalf \u201cfollows from the \ntext of Article II,\u201d \u201cwas settled by the First Congress,\u201d and has been \u201cconfirmed\u201d by the Supreme \nCourt many times. Id.; Collins, 594 U.S. at 250-56; Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 213-32; Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. \nCo. Acct. Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 492-510 (2010); Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 108-76 (1926).  \nThus, \u201cthe President\u2019s power to remove \u2018executive officers of the United States whom he has \nappointed\u2019 may not be regulated by Congress or reviewed by the courts.\u201d  Trump v. United States, 603 \nU.S. 593, 620 (2024) (citation omitted). \nApplying that general rule, the Supreme Court has repeatedly held in recent years that the \nPresident must be able to remove at will sole agency heads.  See Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 220-22. As a \ngeneral matter, the Constitution \u201cscrupulously avoids concentrating power in the hands of any single \nindividual\u201d save for the President, who is \u201cthe most democratic and politically accountable official in \nGovernment.\u201d  Id. at 223-24.  Single agency heads thus must be accountable to the President through \nat-will removal.  There are only four single agency heads upon whom Congress has sought to confer \ntenure protection: the Directors of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and Federal \nHousing Finance Agency (FHFA), the Commissioner of Social Security, and the Special Counsel here. \n7 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 22     Filed 02/21/25     Page 15 of 30\nThe former three are undisputedly subject to at-will removal under Article II.  Supreme Court \nprecedents foreclose any special exception for the Special Counsel. \nStart with the Director of the CFPB.  In Seila Law, the Supreme Court held that Congress had \nviolated Article II by granting tenure protection to that sole agency head.  See 591 U.S. at 220-32.  \u201cThe \nCFPB\u2019s single-Director structure contravene[d] [Article II\u2019s] carefully calibrated system by vesting \nsignificant governmental power in the hands of a single individual accountable to no one.\u201d  Id. at 224.  \n\u201cThe Director [wa]s neither elected by the people nor meaningfully controlled (through the threat of \nremoval) by someone who is.\u201d  Id. at 224-25.  \u201cWith no colleagues to persuade, and no boss or \nelectorate looking over her shoulder,\u201d the Director could \u201cunilaterally\u201d \u201cdictate and enforce policy.\u201d  \nId. at 225. \nThe Supreme Court then extended the at-will-removal rule to the single head of the FHFA.  \nSee Collins, 594 U.S. at 226-28.  The Court found Seila Law \u201call but dispositive,\u201d given that the FHFA \nwas \u201can agency led by a single Director.\u201d  Id. at 250-51.  The Court rejected the contention that the \nFHFA should be treated differently because it exercised less executive power than the CFPB.  See id. \nat 251-53.  The Court explained that \u201cthe nature and breadth of an agency\u2019s authority is not \ndispositive\u201d; that \u201c[t]he President\u2019s removal power serves vital purposes even when the officer sub-\nject to removal is not the head of one of the largest and most powerful agencies\u201d; and that \u201c[c]ourts \nare not well-suited to weigh the relative importance of the regulatory and enforcement authorities of \ndisparate agencies.\u201d  Id. at 251-53.  In short, Article II empowers the President \u201cto remove the head \nof an agency with a single top officer.\u201d  Id. at 256; see id. at 273 (Kagan, J., concurring in part and \nconcurring in the judgment) (\u201cAny \u2018agency led by a single Director,\u2019 no matter how much executive \npower it wields, now becomes subject to the requirement of at-will removal.\u201d); id. at 292 (Sotomayor, \nJ., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\u201cAfter Seila Law, the Court reasons, all that matters is \nthat \u2018the FHFA (like the CFPB) is an agency led by a single Director.\u2019\u201d) (cleaned up). \nThen came the single head of the Social Security Administration.  After Collins, President Biden \nremoved the Commissioner of Social Security without cause, contrary to a statute purporting to make \n8 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 22     Filed 02/21/25     Page 16 of 30\nthat agency head removable only for \u201cneglect of duty or malfeasance in office.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(a)(3).  \nIn supporting that decision, the Office of Legal Counsel explained that \u201cthe best reading of Collins \nand Seila Law\u201d \u201cmeans that the President need not heed the Commissioner\u2019s statutory tenure \nprotection.\u201d  Constitutionality of the Comm\u2019r of Soc. Security\u2019s Tenure Prot., 2021 WL 2981542, at *1, *7 (July \n8, 2021).  The only courts of appeals to have considered the question, the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits, \nhave both held that statutory restrictions on the removal of that single agency head violate Article II. \nSee Rodriguez, 118 F.4th at 1313-14; Kaufmann, 32 F.4th at 848-49. \nB.  This Court Should Not Carve Out an Exception to the President\u2019s Removal \nPower for the Special Counsel.  \nCrafting  a  special  exception  to  at-will  removal  for  the  Special  Counsel  would  plainly \ncontravene those precedents.  \u201c[T]he Special Counsel undoubtedly wields executive power.\u201d  Order \nat 9, Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5028 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 15, 2025) (Katsas, J., dissenting).  The Office of \nSpecial Counsel is an \u201cinvestigative and prosecutorial agency\u201d responsible for executing \u201cfour federal \nlaws\u201d: \u201cthe Civil Service Reform Act, the Whistleblower Protection Act, the Hatch Act, and the \nUniformed Services Employment & Reemployment Rights Act.\u201d  U.S. Office of Special Counsel, \nAbout OSC, https://osc.gov/Agency (last visited Feb. 21, 2025).  The Special Counsel may, among \nother  things,  \u201cinvestigate  allegations  of  prohibited  personnel  actions,\u201d  5  U.S.C.  \u00a7  1212(a)(2); \n\u201cinvestigat[e]\u201d \u201cany allegation\u201d concerning \u201cpolitical activity,\u201d \u201cactivities prohibited by any civil ser-\nvice law,\u201d or \u201cprohibited discrimination,\u201d id. \u00a7 1216(a); and \u201cissue subpoenas\u201d and \u201corder the taking \nof depositions,\u201d id. \u00a7 1212(b)(2).  The Special Counsel also enforces multiple statutes by bringing \ndisciplinary  actions  and  litigating  complaints  before  the  MSPB,  see  id.  \u00a7  1215;  intervening  in \nproceedings before the MSPB, id. \u00a7 1212(c)(1); and litigating in federal court as an amicus curiae, id. \n\u00a7 1212(h)(1).  Further, the Special Counsel may appoint other officials in his agency, see id. \u00a7 1212(d)(1), \nand issue regulations, see id. \u00a7 1212(e). \nThose are executive functions\u2014and significant ones at that.  See Order at 4, Dellinger v. Bessent, \nNo. 24A790 (U.S. Feb. 21, 2025) (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (describing Plaintiff as an officer who \n9 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 22     Filed 02/21/25     Page 17 of 30\n\u201cwields significant prosecutorial and investigative power as the sole head of a 129-person office.\u201d).  At \nthe outset, the Department of Justice recognized that \u201cthe Special Counsel\u2019s functions are executive \nin character\u201d; that his powers \u201care directed at the enforcement of the laws\u201d; and that his \u201crole in \ninvestigating and prosecuting prohibited practices is much the same as that of a U.S. Attorney or other \nFederal prosecutors.\u201d  2 Op. O.L.C. 120 (1978).  The D.C. Circuit has noted that the Special Counsel \nis a \u201cprosecutor . . . of merit system abuses\u201d who pursues administrative enforcement actions that are \n\u201ccomparable to criminal prosecutions designed to vindicate the public interest.\u201d  Frazier v. MSPB, 672 \nF.2d 150, 163 (1982) (emphasis omitted); see Barnhart v. Devine, 771 F.2d 1515, 1520 (D.C. Cir. 1985) \n(describing the Special Counsel as the MSPB\u2019s \u201cprosecutorial arm\u201d).  The MSPB, too, has described \nthe Special Counsel\u2019s relationship to it as like \u201cthat of a prosecuting attorney to a court.\u201d  Layser v. \nUSDA, 8 M.S.P.B. 72, 73 (1981).  Even the Office of Special Counsel agrees that it is an \u201cinvestigatory \nand prosecutorial agency,\u201d U.S. Office of Special Counsel, About OSC, https://osc.gov/Agency (last \nvisited Feb. 21, 2025), that is located \u201cwithin the executive branch,\u201d OSC Annual Report at 9.  \n\u201cInvestigative and prosecutorial decisionmaking is \u2018the special province of the Executive Branch,\u2019 and \nthe Constitution vests the entirety of the executive power in the President.\u201d Trump, 603 U.S. at 620 \n(citation omitted). \nThus,  the  unconstitutionality  of  the Special  Counsel\u2019s  tenure  protection  has  long  been \napparent.  The Executive Branch has repeatedly objected to that protection since the enactment of \nthe Civil Service Reform Act in 1978.  During the Carter Administration, the Department of Justice \nexplained that, \u201c[b]ecause the Special Counsel [would] be performing largely executive functions, the \nCongress [could] not restrict the President\u2019s power to remove him.\u201d  2 Op. O.L.C. at 121; see Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 221 (noting that the statutory tenure provision elicited a \u201ccontemporaneous \nconstitutional objection\u201d).  In 1988, President Reagan pocket-vetoed a bill that would have vested the \nOffice of Special Counsel with additional powers, explaining that the legislation \u201craised serious \nconstitutional concerns\u201d by, among other things, \u201cpurport[ing] to insulate the Office from presidential \nsupervision and to limit the power of the President to remove his subordinates from office.\u201d  Public \n10 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 22     Filed 02/21/25     Page 18 of 30\nPapers of the Presidents, Ronald Reagan, Vol. II, Oct. 26, 1988, at 1391-92 (1991); see Seila Law, 591 \nU.S. at 221 (noting that President Reagan vetoed the bill \u201con constitutional grounds\u201d).  And, several \nyears ago, the Acting Solicitor General filed a brief in the Supreme Court explaining that, on the \ngovernment\u2019s reading of Supreme Court precedents, \u201cthe President must have the power to remove \nat will the single heads of the Social Security Administration and Office of Special Counsel.\u201d  Gov\u2019t \nReply & Response Br. at 26, Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (No. 19-422). \nC.  This Court Misapplied This Precedent in Granting a Temporary Restraining \nOrder.  \nIn its prior order, the Court stated that \u201cthe reasoning underlying\u201d Seila Law and Collins \u201cdoes \nnot extend to the unique office and official involved in this case\u201d and that OSC \u201ccannot be compared \nto those involved when the Supreme Court found the removal for cause requirement to be an \nunconstitutional intrusion on Presidential power.\u201d  Order at 9.  But that analysis gets things backwards.  \nSee Order at 9, Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5028 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 15, 2025) (Katsas, J., dissenting) (\u201cUnder \n[the] rules\u201d set forth by the Supreme Court, \u201cCongress cannot constitutionally restrict the President\u2019s \npower to remove the Special Counsel.\u201d).  Supreme Court precedents recognize a \u201cgeneral rule\u201d of \n\u201cunrestricted removal,\u201d subject to only \u201ctwo exceptions.\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 215.  First, in \nHumphrey\u2019s Executor, 295 U.S. 602, the Court concluded that Congress could provide tenure protection \nto \u201ca multimember body of experts, balanced along partisan lines, that performed legislative and \njudicial functions and was said not to exercise any executive power.\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 216.2  \nSecond, the Court has concluded that Congress could provide tenure protection to \u201ccertain inferior \nofficers with narrowly defined duties.\u201d  Id. at 204 (citing Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988), and \nUnited States v. Perkins, 116 U.S. 483 (1886)).  Those two exceptions represent \u201cthe outermost \n \n2 Humphrey\u2019s Executor appears to have misapprehended the powers of \u201cthe New Deal-era [Federal \nTrade Commission]\u201d and misclassified those powers as primarily legislative and judicial.  Seila Law, \n591 U.S. at 218.  The exception recognized in Humphrey\u2019s Executor thus does not apply to multimember \nagencies that exercise substantial executive power, for instance by promulgating binding rules or \nissuing final decisions in administrative adjudications.  See U.S. Dep\u2019t of Just., Office of Information \nPolicy, 02.12.25. - 530D Speaker Johnson, https://www.justice.gov/oip/ media/1389526. \n11 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 22     Filed 02/21/25     Page 19 of 30\nconstitutional limits of permissible congressional restrictions on the President\u2019s removal power.\u201d Id. \nat 218 (citation omitted).  These exceptions are inapt.  As this Court has recognized, the Special \nCounsel \u201cis not entirely analogous\u201d to the \u201cFTC panel members\u201d in Humphrey\u2019s Executor or the \n\u201cIndependent Counsel\u201d in Morrison.  Order at 12-13.  And Supreme Court precedents establish a \nbright-line rule: \u201c[T]he Constitution prohibits even \u2018modest restrictions\u2019 on the President\u2019s power to \nremove the head of an agency with a single top officer.\u201d  Collins, 594 U.S. at 256 (citation omitted).   \nThe Court also previously distinguished Seila Law and Collins on the ground that the Special \nCounsel exercises \u201climited jurisdiction,\u201d deals with \u201ca small subset\u201d of federal employees, \u201cdoes not \nhave broad rulemaking authority or wield substantial enforcement authority,\u201d and does not \u201caffec[t] a \nbroad swath of the American public or its economy.\u201d  Order at 15-16.  But Collins refutes that rationale, \nmaking clear that the President\u2019s power to remove sole agency heads does not \u201ching[e] on\u201d \u201cthe \nrelative importance of the regulatory and enforcement authority of disparate agencies.\u201d  594 U.S. at \n253.  Article II contains no exception for \u201climited\u201d exercises of executive power that purportedly \naffect only \u201csmall\u201d groups of people. Cf. Morrison, 487 U.S. at 718 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe \nAmbassador to Luxembourg is not anything less than a principal [executive] officer, simply because \nLuxembourg is small.\u201d).  And the Special Counsel executes multiple federal laws by investigating \nallegations of wrongdoing, issuing subpoenas, bringing disciplinary actions, and participating in \nproceedings before the Merit Systems Protection Board.  \nThe Court later emphasized that, in Seila Law and Collins, the Supreme Court did \u201cnot \ncomment on the constitutionality of any removal restriction\u201d applicable to other agencies that were \nnot before the Court.

Haddock, 201 U.S. 562, 631 (1906) (Holmes, J., dissenting).  \nThe results in Seila Law and Collins may have concerned only the CFPB and FHFA, but just as the \nSupreme Court in Collins found the reasoning of Seila Law \u201call but dispositive\u201d for the FHFA Director, \n594 U.S. at 250-51, the reasoning of Collins is all but dispositive here.  See id. at 273 (Kagan, J., \n12 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 22     Filed 02/21/25     Page 20 of 30\nconcurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (\u201cAny \u2018agency led by a single Director,\u2019 no matter \nhow much executive power it wields, now becomes subject to the requirement of at-will removal.\u201d) \n(citation omitted); see id. at 292 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\u201cAfter Seila \nLaw, the Court reasons, all that matters is that \u2018the FHFA (like the CFPB) is an agency led by a single \nDirector.\u2019\u201d) (citation omitted). \nThe Court also analogized the Special Counsel to the Independent Counsel, whose removal \nprotections were sustained in Morrison.  Order at 11.  But Morrison concerned an inferior officer \nappointed by a court of law, not a principal officer appointed by the President with the advice and \nconsent of the Senate to lead a freestanding executive department.  As described more fully below, \nbecause the Special Counsel \u201cis not an inferior officer,\u201d \u201c[t]he logic of Morrison . . . does not apply.\u201d  \nSeila Law, 591 U.S. at 219.  \nThe Court also noted that Presidents Carter and George H.W.

The Court added that, when concluding that President \nBiden could fire the Commissioner of Social Security at will, the Office of Legal Counsel \u201cd[id] not \naddress the validity of tenure protections conferred on the Special Counsel.\u201d  Order at 15 n.4 (quoting \nConstitutionality of the Comm\u2019r of Soc.

Plaintiff\u2019s Contrary Arguments Are Meritless.  \nFirst, Plaintiff argues that he is an inferior officer.  ECF No. 21 (\u201cPl.\u2019s PI Reply\u201d) at 3-4.  That \nis plainly wrong.  See Order at 9, Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5028 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 15, 2025) (Katsas, J., \ndissenting) (\u201c[T]he Special Counsel is not an inferior officer.\u201d).  Someone is an inferior officer only if \n\u201c\u2018he has a superior\u2019 other than the President\u201d who has the authority to \u201cdirec[t] and supervis[e] him.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Arthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. 1, 13 (2021) (quoting Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, 662 \n(1997)).  The MSPB does not appoint or remove him\u2014only the President can do that.  And OSC is \na freestanding federal agency that is not contained within or subordinate to any other agency.  That \nmeans that the Office is a \u201cDepartment[]\u201d and the Special Counsel is its \u201cHea[d].\u201d  U.S. Const. art. II, \n\u00a7 2, cl. 2; see Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 511.  Department heads, by definition, cannot be inferior \nofficers.  See Freytag v. Comm\u2019r, 501 U.S. 868, 884 (1991); id. at 917-18 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and \nconcurring in the judgment). \nRegardless, Plaintiff\u2019s newfound claim to be an inferior officer does not save his tenure \nprotection.  In Myers, the Supreme Court held that Article II empowers the President to remove \n\u201cinferior executive officers\u201d whom he has appointed.  272 U.S. at 161; see id. at 158 (upholding the \n\u201cremoval of a postmaster\u201d even though \u201ca postmaster is an inferior officer\u201d).  True, the Supreme \nCourt has upheld restrictions on the removal of certain inferior officers appointed by department \nheads, see United States v. Perkins, 163 U.S. 625 (1896), or by courts, see Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 \n(1988).  But Myers holds that if Congress may restrict the removal of inferior executive officers at all, \nCongress may do so only if it has \u201cvest[ed] the appointment in some one other than the President \nwith the consent of the Senate.\u201d  272 U.S. at 162.  If an inferior officer is sufficiently important to \nrequire the Senate\u2019s participation in his appointment, then the President must be able to fire him at \nwill.  See id. at 161-162. The Special Counsel is a sole agency head appointed by the President with the \nSenate\u2019s consent. \nSecond, Plaintiff argues that the Special Counsel plays only a \u201climited\u201d role and that \u201cthe \nSpecial Counsel\u2019s powers do not resemble the authority of the principal officers who lead the CFPB \n14 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 22     Filed 02/21/25     Page 22 of 30\nand FHFA.\u201d  Pl.\u2019s PI Reply at 4-5.  But Collins could not be clearer that \u201cthe Constitution prohibits \neven \u2018modest restrictions\u2019 on the President\u2019s power to remove the head of an agency with a single top \nofficer\u201d; that the \u201cremoval power serves vital purposes even when the officer subject to removal is \nnot the head of one of the largest and most powerful agencies\u201d; and that the scope of the removal \npower does not \u201ching[e] on\u201d \u201can inquiry\u201d into \u201cthe relative importance of the regulatory and \nenforcement authority of disparate agencies.\u201d  594 U.S. at 252-253, 256 (citation omitted). \nThird, Plaintiff appears to question whether the Special Counsel exercises \u201cexecutive power\u201d \nat all and argues that the Office promotes a \u201cshared inter-branch interest.\u201d  Pl.\u2019s PI Reply at 5-6.  But \nthe Office describes itself as an \u201cinvestigatory and prosecutorial agency,\u201d https://osc.gov/Agency, \nthat is located \u201cwithin the executive branch,\u201d U.S. Office of Special Counsel Annual Report for Fiscal Year \n2023, at 9.  \u201cInvestigative and prosecutorial decisionmaking is \u2018the special province of the Executive \nBranch,\u2019 and the Constitution vests the entirety of the executive power in the President.\u201d  Trump, 603 \nU.S. at 620 (citation omitted).  Plaintiff adds that the Special Counsel ensures \u201ccompliance with \ncongressionally imposed ethical and personnel requirements.\u201d  Pl.\u2019s PI Reply at 5.  That is a \nroundabout way of saying that he executes federal laws\u2014the very job of executive officers subject to \nthe President\u2019s supervision and control. \nFourth, Plaintiff suggests that the Court should recognize a new exception to the President\u2019s \nremoval  power  given  the  Office  of  Special  Counsel\u2019s  \u201cunique\u201d  status  and  alleged  \u201cneed  for \nindependence.\u201d  Pl.\u2019s PI Reply at 6.  But nothing about OSC justifies recognizing a new exception to \nthe \u201cgeneral rule\u201d of \u201cunrestricted removal,\u201d Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 215.  The Supreme Court has held \nthe opposite many times, has cabined the \u201ctwo exceptions to the President\u2019s unrestricted removal \npower\u201d as representing \u201cthe outermost constitutional limits of permissible congressional restrictions\u201d \non removal, and has warned against extending those exceptions to \u201cnovel context[s].\u201d  Id. at 204, 218 \n(citation omitted).   \nFor all of these reasons, the President\u2019s removal of Plaintiff was lawful. \n15 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 22     Filed 02/21/25     Page 23 of 30\nII.  Plaintiff Is Not Entitled to An Injunction.  \nTo establish his entitlement to a permanent injunction, Plaintiff must demonstrate: \u201c\u2018(1) that \nhe has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are \ninadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the balance of hardships between the \nplaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) that the public interest would not be \ndisserved by a permanent injunction.\u2019\u201d  Anatol Zukerman & Charles Krause Reporting, LLC v. U.S. Postal \nServ., 64 F.4th 1354, 1364 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (quoting eBay Inc. v.

Plaintiff has not established any of these factors.  \nA.  Plaintiff Cannot Show Entitlement to Reinstatement.  \nThis Court lacks the power to issue any order reinstating a principal executive officer removed \nby the President.  See Order at 3, Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 24A790 (U.S. Feb. 21, 2025) (Gorsuch, J., \ndissenting) (explaining that courts can only issue equitable remedies that existed at the founding and \nthat \u201ccourts of equity at the time of the founding were apparently powerless to \u2018restrain an executive \nofficer from making a . . . removal of a subordinate appointee.\u2019\u201d) (quoting White, 171 U.

But \nMyers and Humphrey were, of course, alive at the time of their removals, yet neither sought an \ninjunction restoring him to office.  Each waited, let back-pay claims accumulate, and eventually \nasserted those claims in court, directly or through an executor.  Myers was removed in February 1920, \nsued for back pay in April 1921, and was later succeeded as a plaintiff by the administrator of his \nestate.  Myers, 272 U.S. at 106, 108.  And Humphrey\u2019s executor sought salary due to Humphrey \u201cfrom \n \n16 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 22     Filed 02/21/25     Page 24 of 30\n25-5028 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 15, 2025) (Katsas, J., dissenting) (\u201c[C]ourts may not enjoin the President \nregarding the performance of his official acts, regarding removal or otherwise . . . That is why removed \nexecutive officers traditionally have sought judicial review not through injunctive actions against the \nPresident for reinstatement, but through backpay actions for damages.\u201d).  That rule reflects the \nobvious Article II problems that arise if a court attempts to reinstate a principal executive officer \nremoved by the President.  The President cannot be compelled to retain the services of a principal \nofficer whom he no longer believes should be entrusted with the exercise of executive power.   \nIndeed, many members of the First Congress argued against requiring the Senate\u2019s advice and \nconsent for removals precisely because of the risk that such a procedure would require the President \nto retain someone he had sought to remove.  As Representative Benson observed: \u201cIf the Senate, \nupon its meeting, were to acquit the officer, and replace him in his station, the President would then \nhave a man forced on him whom he considered as unfaithful.\u201d  Myers, 272 U.S. at 124 (citation \nomitted).  Representative Boudinot argued: \u201cBut suppose [the Senate] shall decide in favor of the \nofficer, what a situation is the President then in, surrounded by officers with whom, by his situation, \nhe is compelled to act, but in whom he can have no confidence.\u201d  Id. at 131-32 (citation omitted).  \nAnd Representative Sedwick asked rhetorically: \u201cShall a man under these circumstances be saddled \nupon the President, who has been appointed for no other purpose but to aid the President in \nperforming certain duties? Shall he be continued, I ask again, against the will of the President?\u201d  Id. at \n132 (citation omitted).  The injunction Plaintiff seeks raises just this problem. \nAn injunction would also exceed the scope of this Court\u2019s equitable powers.  A federal court \nmay grant only those equitable remedies that were \u201ctraditionally accorded by courts of equity.\u201d  Grupo \nMexicano de Desarrollo S.A. v. All. Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U.S. 308, 319 (1999).  Reinstatement of a public \nofficial is not such a remedy.  \u201cIt is . . . well settled that a court of equity has no jurisdiction over the \nappointment and removal of public officers.\u201d  In re Sawyer, 124 U.S. 200, 212 (1888).

Plaintiff argues that courts could reinstate wrongly removed public officers by issuing a \nwrit of quo warranto (which is a legal rather than an equitable remedy), see Pl.\u2019s PI Reply 7, but Plaintiff \nhas  not  sought  quo  warranto  or  attempted  to  satisfy  the  distinct  procedural  and  substantive \nprerequisites for that relief, see Andrade v.

Feb. 15, 2025) (Katsas, J., dissenting) (explaining that Berry does not apply to this case \nbecause \u201c[t]here is no reason to think that routine succession would tend to destabilize OSC\u201d); English \nv. Trump, 279 F. Supp. 3d 307, 334-35 (D.D.C. 2018) (distinguishing Berry from case in which plaintiff \nsought to be installed as Acting Director of CFPB). \nTo the extent the harm Plaintiff asserts is harm to the OSC, that assertion is misplaced.  The \ncontention that denying him relief would deprive the OSC of the inability to fulfill its mandate is both \nincorrect and merely a repackaging of Plaintiff\u2019s contention that he is the best person for the position \nand that the President had no sound reason for removing him\u2014i.e., that an OSC with Plaintiff as a \nmember would better serve the agency\u2019s mission than one without him.  That is the President\u2019s \nprerogative to determine. \nC.  The Balance of the Equities and Public Interest Weigh Strongly in Favor of the \nGovernment.  \nThe balance of the equities and public interest weigh strongly against Plaintiff\u2019s reinstatement \nas Special Counsel.  Because the Special Counsel exercises executive authority, reinstalling as its head \na person the President does not wish to entrust with the exercise of Executive power would work a \ngreat and irreparable harm to the Executive.  Such a remedy would undermine the accountability of \nthe Executive Branch instilled by the Constitution.  The President \u201cis elected by the entire Nation\u201d \nand all executive officers \u201cremain[] subject to the ongoing supervision and control of the elected \nPresident.\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 224.  Adding additional exceptions to that constitutional rule\u2014and \nthen, under those exceptions, reinstating principal officers whom the President has removed from \noffice\u2014\u201cheightens the concern that\u201d the Executive Branch \u201cmay slip from the Executive\u2019s control, \nand thus from that of the people.\u201d  Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 499. \nThis Court previously stated that Defendants failed to identify \u201ccircumstances that required \nthe President\u2019s hasty, unexplained action, or that would justify the immediate ejection of the Senate-\n21 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 22     Filed 02/21/25     Page 29 of 30\nconfirmed Special Counsel,\u201d Order at 25, but that reasoning is incompatible with the notion of \nremoval at will.  A President may remove executive officers for many reasons: to remove \u201cthose he \nfinds \u2018negligent and inefficient,\u2019\u201d \u201cthose who exercise their discretion in a way that is not \u2018intelligent \nor wise,\u2019\u201d \u201cthose who have \u2018different views of policy,\u201d \u201cthose who come from a competing political \nparty,\u201d and \u201cthose in whom he has . . . lost confidence.\u201d  Collins, 594 U.S. at 256 (brackets and citation \nomitted).  Presidents may remove executive officers simply because they want to appoint someone \nelse.  \u201c[T]he President\u2019s power to remove \u2018executive officers of the United States\u2019 may not be regulated \nby Congress or reviewed by the courts.\u201d Trump, 603 U.S. at 621 (emphasis added; citation omitted).   \nThe Court also previously remarked that the Executive Branch did not face significant harm \nbecause OSC has a \u201cnarrow focus,\u201d Order at 25, but any encroachment on the President\u2019s ability to \nexercise his executive power causes him significant harm.  Fundamentally, \u201c[i]t is not for [this Court] \nto determine, and [the Court has] never presumed to determine, how much of the purely executive \npowers of government must be within the full control of the President. The Constitution prescribes \nthat they all are.\u201d  Morrison, 487 U.S. at 709 (Scalia, J., dissenting).  And in any event, the Court \nunderstates the extent of the Special Counsel\u2019s powers.  As noted, the Special Counsel may appoint \npersonnel, promulgate regulations, launch investigations, issue subpoenas, bring disciplinary actions, \nand represent the Executive in proceedings in court and before the Merit Systems Protection Board.   \nConversely, the public interest would not be served by reinstating Plaintiff.  As discussed \nabove, OSC\u2019s ability to resume its functions could be accomplished by other means\u2014namely, the \nappointment of a different individual as Special Counsel.  And the public would be better served by \nthe appointment of a principal officer who holds the President\u2019s confidence and can effectively serve \nhim in executing his duties as Chief Executive than by Plaintiff\u2019s instatement.   \nMoreover, reinstating Plaintiff would not provide any clarity.  To the contrary, a court order \npermanently reinstating Plaintiff would cause further confusion.  As described, it is not at all clear that \nany Defendant besides the President has the authority to reinstate Plaintiff to his vacated seat, see U.S. \nConst. art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2 (vesting authority to appoint principal officers in President alone), or that this \n22 \n \n \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 22     Filed 02/21/25     Page 30 of 30\nCourt could direct the President to do so, see Swan v. Clinton, 100 F.3d 973, 976 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (\u201cA \nquestion exists, however, as to whether a federal court has the power to grant injunctive relief against \nthe President of the United States in the exercise of his official duties.\u201d); Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 \nU.S. 788, 802-03 (1992).  Furthermore, because Defendants are likely to succeed in affirming the \nconstitutionality of Plaintiff\u2019s removal on further review, any actions the OSC takes while headed by \nan officer who has been reinstated by this Court after his removal by the President would be called \ninto question and potentially voidable.  See Collins, 594 U.S. at 259 (private parties may be entitled to a \nremedy when an unconstitutional removal restriction \u201cinflict[s] compensable harm,\u201d such as if \u201cthe \nPresident had attempted to remove [an agency head] but was prevented from doing so by a lower \ncourt decision\u201d).  Thus, Plaintiff\u2019s claimed equities cannot outweigh the grave and unprecedented \nharm an injunction would cause to the separation of powers and the President\u2019s authority to \u201ctake \nCare the Laws be faithfully executed.\u201d  U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 1, cl. 1. \nCONCLUSION \n  For the reasons above, the Court should grant summary judgment in favor of Defendants. \n \nDated: February 21, 2025        Respectfully submitted, \n               \n              BRETT A.

President Trump nevertheless purported to remove \nhim without cause. In defense of that position, the government\u2014on behalf of the President and the \nother named Defendants\u2014claims that \u00a7 1211(b) is unconstitutional. The government also contends \nthat the Court lacks any power to preserve Special Counsel Dellinger in office, even if the \nPresident\u2019s purported termination was unlawful. The government is mistaken on both points. \nBecause those are purely legal questions and there are no disputes of material fact, the Court should \ngrant summary judgment to Special Counsel Dellinger and enter an order providing proper \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief.  \nBACKGROUND \nA.  The United States Office of Special Counsel \n1.  The Founding and Mission of the OSC \nThe Office of Special Counsel (\u201cOSC\u201d) is an independent federal agency, originally \nestablished by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (\u201cCSRA\u201d). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(a). The \nCSRA was enacted to address widespread public concerns about the federal civil service\u2014\nincluding  evidence  that  it  was  vulnerable  to  political  manipulation  and  failed  to  protect \nwhistleblowers. See Developments in the Law\u2014Public Employment, 97 Harv. L. Rev. 1619, 1631-\n32 (1984). The CSRA began with President Carter, who recommended creating a Special Counsel, \n\u201cappointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate\u201d to investigate abuses of civil service \nlaws, and the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d), a nonpartisan board removable only for \ncause to adjudicate those disputes. See Federal Civil Service Reform Message to the Congress \n(Mar. 2, 1978). This structure, President Carter wrote, would \u201cguarantee independent and impartial \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 23     Filed 02/24/25     Page 12 of 40\nprotection to employees\u201d and thereby \u201csafeguard the rights of Federal employees who \u2018blow the \nwhistle\u2019 on violations of laws or regulations by other employees, including their supervisors.\u201d Id. \nCongress accepted President Carter\u2019s proposal, including the MSPB and the Special \nCounsel with for-cause removal protections. See S. 2640, 95th Cong. (Mar. 3, 1978); H.R. Rep. \nNo. 95-1403, at 388 (1978) (supp. views of Rep. S. Solarz). Congress made an express finding that \n\u201cthe authority and power of the Special Counsel\u201d was required to \u201cinvestigate allegations involving \nprohibited personnel practices and reprisals against Federal employees.\u201d Civil Service Reform Act \nof 1978, \u00a7 3(4), Pub. L. No. 95-454, \u00a7 3(4), 92 Stat. 1111, 1112. Consistent with this vision, \nCongress  provided  that  the  Special  Counsel  could  be  removed  \u201cby  the  President  only  for \ninefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, \u00a7 1204. \nThis provision drew an initial objection from the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Legal \nCounsel (\u201cOLC\u201d), which President Carter effectively overruled when he subsequently signed the \nlaw and declared it would create \u201ca new system of excellence and accountability.\u201d Compare \nMemorandum Opinion for the General Counsel, Civil Service Commission, 2 Op. O.L.C. 120 \n(1978), with Jimmy Carter, Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 Statement on Signing S. 2640 Into \nLaw (Oct. 13, 1978).1 \nIn 1988, Congress again grew concerned that federal whistleblowers were not adequately \nprotected, and crafted the Whistleblower Protection Act to \u201cstrengthen and improve protection for \nthe rights of Federal employees, to prevent reprisals, and to help eliminate wrongdoing within the \nGovernment.\u201d Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-12, \u00a7 2(b), 103 Stat. 16, 16. \n \n1 The OLC opinion referenced here was requested not by President Carter but instead by the Civil \nService Commission, which would be replaced in the proposed CSRA. 2 Op. O.L.C. at 120. \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 23     Filed 02/24/25     Page 13 of 40\nAs originally drafted, the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1988 separated the OSC from \nthe MSPB, establishing the OSC as an independent agency. The original draft also vested the OSC \nwith new powers. President Reagan, however, pocket vetoed this legislation, objecting to several \nnew authorities that the legislation would vest in the OSC\u2014singling out the authority to seek \njudicial review of adverse MSPB decisions in federal court, which would \u201cpermit[] the Executive \nbranch  to  litigate  against  itself.\u201d  Ronald  Reagan,  Memorandum  of  Disapproval  on  a  Bill \nConcerning Whistleblower Protection (Oct. 26, 1988). President Reagan also suggested hesitancy \nabout the bill\u2019s for-cause removal protections, which were identical to those already in effect. Id. \nAfter the pocket veto, Congress worked with Presidents Reagan and Bush to address their \nseparation-of-powers  concerns.  After  these  negotiations,  the  revised  bill\u2014the  enacted \nWhistleblower Protection Act of 1989\u2014no longer authorized the OSC to pursue litigation against \nother agencies in federal court. See 135 Cong. Rec. 5012, 5037 (Mar. 21, 1989) (statement of Rep. \nP. Schroeder) (\u201c[W]e agreed to make the changes requested by the administration to clip the special \ncounsel\u2019s wings.\u201d); id. at 5039 (statement of Rep. S. Parris) (\u201cAs amended, S. 20 would resolve \nthe administration\u2019s constitutional concerns by eliminating the right of the special counsel to sue \nin Federal court.\u201d).  \nBut those negotiations did not displace the OSC\u2019s status as an independent agency or its \nexisting for-cause removal provision. As the House Subcommittee on Civil Service stated, federal \nemployees required \u201cassurance that the Office of Special Counsel is a safe haven,\u201d because \notherwise it \u201ccan never be effective in protecting victims of prohibited personnel practices.\u201d Id. at \n5034  (Joint  Explanatory  Statement);  id.  at  5032  (statement  of  Rep.  G.  Sikorski)  (\u201cUntil \nwhistleblowers are confident that the Office of Special Counsel is on their side, that office will not \nbe  an  effective  advocate  for  their  cause.\u201d).  Following  this  inter-branch  agreement  on  the \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 23     Filed 02/24/25     Page 14 of 40\nimportance of maintaining a measure of independence for the OSC, President Bush\u2019s Attorney \nGeneral thanked the bill\u2019s sponsor for \u201cforg[ing] a mutually acceptable resolution of our serious \nconstitutional concerns\u201d and \u201cpledge[d]\u201d to lobby for the Act as drafted. See Letter from Office of \nthe Attorney General to Sen. Levin dated Mar. 3, 1989, 135 Cong. Rec. 5012, 5033-34. \nUltimately, President Bush agreed that the revisions had \u201caddressed\u201d the \u201cconstitutional \nconcerns\u201d he and President Reagan had raised about the Act. George H.W. Bush, Remarks on \nSigning the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (Apr. 10, 1989). Indeed, he specifically praised \nthat the Act would \u201cenhance the authority of the Office of Special Counsel to protect whistle-\nblowers,\u201d and that it \u201cretain[ed] current law which provides that the Special Counsel may only be \nremoved for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance.\u201d Id. Rather than reserve the question or \ncall this provision into doubt, President Bush thus made apparent his approval of the for-cause \nremoval limitation, which reflected a deliberate interbranch settlement of constitutional issues. \n2.  The OSC\u2019s Limited Jurisdiction and Functions \nAs contemplated by Congress and two Presidents in the enactments described above, the \nOSC maintains a unique and partly independent position to protect federal employees from \nprohibited personnel practices (\u201cPPPs\u201d)\u2014especially reprisal for whistleblowing. The OSC also \naffords a secure channel for employees to blow the whistle on wrongdoing. And it assists \nCongress\u2019s legislative and oversight agendas. \nNone of the OSC\u2019s authorities empowers it to regulate or penalize private activity. Instead, \nas an \u201combudsman\u201d and \u201cwatchdog,\u201d Frazier v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., 672 F.2d 150, 162-63 (D.C. \nCir. 1982), the OSC has \u201conly limited jurisdiction to enforce certain rules governing Federal \nGovernment employers and employees,\u201d Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau, 591 U.S. \n197, 221 (2020). And even as to federal employees, the OSC does not impose any discipline or \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 23     Filed 02/24/25     Page 15 of 40\nother adverse action. Instead, the OSC receives allegations of PPPs and Hatch Act violations, \nassesses and investigates such complaints, and promotes a proper course of action. See 5 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 1212(a), 1216(c). Where the OSC finds that an allegation was warranted, it first works with the \nrelevant agency head to encourage voluntary corrective action and relief for the PPP victim (or \nvoluntary discipline from an agency head in the case of a Hatch Act violation). However, any \nrecommended action by the OSC may be rejected: the Special Counsel has no power to bind any \nother agency. Absent voluntary settlement, the OSC may petition the MSPB on the injured \nemployee\u2019s behalf. Id. \u00a7 1214. But an injured employee may also petition the MSPB directly \n(subject to certain procedural requirements). Id. \u00a7 1221.  \nIn addition, the OSC can refer a complaint to the MSPB, asking that a perpetrator of a PPP \nor Hatch Act violation be disciplined. See id. \u00a7\u00a7 1215, 1216. In such circumstances, the OSC \nexercises no authority over the MSPB, which is an independent adjudicatory agency whose \nmembers separately enjoy for-cause removal protections. Id. \u00a7 1202(d). \u201c[T]he MSPB is free to \ndisagree with the Special Counsel and often does.\u201d Am. Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Emps., AFL-CIO v. \nO\u2019Connor (\u201cAFGE\u201d), 747 F.2d 748, 753 (D.C. Cir. 1984). In that respect, the MSPB supervises \nthe OSC\u2019s exercise of authority to refer complaints and makes its own decisions. Similarly, while \nthe OSC has limited authority to issue subpoenas, only the MSPB can seek to enforce such \nsubpoenas. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1212(b)(3)(A). Thus, as the D.C. Circuit has explained, \u201cthe Special \nCounsel\u2019s \u2018seemingly broad powers are greatly circumscribed in practice, [in part] by the Special \nCounsel\u2019s lack of authority to require either the Board or other agencies to do its bidding.\u2019\u201d AFGE, \n747 F.2d at 753 (quoting 97 Harv. L. Rev. at 1643). Even when the MSPB\u2014not the OSC\u2014chooses \nto impose discipline, the maximum \u201ccivil penalty\u201d it can issue is $1,330. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1216(a)(3); 5 \nCFR \u00a7 1201.126(a). And any decision by the MSPB is subject to judicial review in federal court. \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 23     Filed 02/24/25     Page 16 of 40\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1214(c)(2), 1215(a)(4), 7703(b). The OSC cannot participate in any litigation in any \nArticle III court, except in a limited role as amicus curiae. See id. \u00a7 1212(h). \nBeyond  its  human-resources  investigative  role,  the  Whistleblower  Protection  Act \nauthorizes the OSC to receive reports from employee-whistleblowers within agencies. See id. \n\u00a7 1213(a). However, if a report appears credible, the OSC cannot conduct its own investigation or \notherwise take direct action on the report. Instead, it may only review the investigation conducted \nby the whistleblower\u2019s agency, and then report the investigation and the OSC\u2019s own assessment \nof it to Congress and the President. See id. \u00a7\u00a7 1212(a)(3), 1213(c)-(e). The Special Counsel must \nkeep the identity of any whistleblower strictly confidential. Id. \u00a7 1213(h).2 \nThe OSC is also vested with limited authority to \u201cprescribe . . . regulations,\u201d although this \nauthority is strictly and statutorily limited only to internal matters \u201cnecessary to perform the \nfunctions of the Special Counsel.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1212(e). The Special Counsel may separately issue \nnonbinding advisory opinions concerning the Hatch Act, but he has no rulemaking authority that \ncompels compliance. Id. \u00a7 1212(f); see also, e.g., AFGE, 747 F.2d at 752 (\u201c[T]he advice the \nSpecial Counsel is permitted to give creates no law and binds neither the public nor any agency or \nofficer of government.\u201d); Authority for Issuing Hatch Act Regulations, 18 Op. O.L.C. 1, 1 (1994). \nFinally, virtually every action undertaken by the OSC\u2014from receipt of allegations, to \ninvestigations, to agreed corrective actions, to complaints in the MSPB\u2014must be directly reported \nto Congress to inform oversight and legislative functions in this space. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1217, 1218. \n \n2 In a similarly advisory capacity, the OSC reviews regulations issued by the Office of Personnel \nManagement for any rule that would require committing a PPP. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1212(a)(4). \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 23     Filed 02/24/25     Page 17 of 40\nB.  Procedural History \nPlaintiff Hampton Dellinger has served as Special Counsel since March 6, 2024, following \nhis nomination by the President and confirmation by the Senate to a five-year term. On Friday, \nFebruary 7, 2025, at 7:22 PM, Special Counsel Dellinger received an email from Sergio Gor, \nAssistant to the President and Director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, that \nstated: \u201cOn behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position as \nSpecial Counsel of the US Office of Special Counsel is terminated, effective immediately. Thank \nyou for your service[.]\u201d Ex. A to Compl., No. 25 Civ. 385 (D.D.C. Feb. 10, 2025), ECF 1-1. \nThe following Monday, February 10, 2025, Special Counsel Dellinger filed a complaint \nand simultaneously sought a temporary restraining order to preserve the status quo ante pending \nfurther proceedings. That afternoon, this Court held an in-person hearing. The Court proposed that \nthe government \u201cextend the effective date of the President\u2019s proposed action while [the parties] \nbrief [the motion],\u201d but the government refused that proposal. Tr. Of Mot. for TRO (\u201cTr.\u201d) 3:1-18, \nNo. 25 Civ. 385 (D.D.C. Feb. 10, 2025), ECF 9. The government then requested leave to file an \nopposition the next day to Special Counsel Dellinger\u2019s TRO application. Id. 27:23-24. The Court \nagreed, noting that it may issue an administrative stay to preserve the status quo ante while it \ndecided  the  TRO  application.  Id.  25:8-11.  That  evening,  the  Court  issued  a  three-day \nadministrative stay, ordering that Special Counsel Dellinger be allowed to continue to serve in his \nposition through midnight on February 13, 2025. See Order, No. 25 Civ. 385 (D.D.C. Feb. 10, \n2025, 8:20 PM). \nThe next morning, the government filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit \na motion for an emergency stay pending appeal. Emergency Mot. for a Stay Pending Appeal, No. \n25-5025 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 11, 2025), ECF 4. One day later, Special Counsel Dellinger filed a \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 23     Filed 02/24/25     Page 18 of 40\nresponse. Opp. to Emergency Mot. for a Stay, No. 25-5025 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 12, 2025), ECF 7. That \nevening,  the  D.C.  Circuit  denied  the  government\u2019s  motion  and  sua  sponte  dismissed  the \ngovernment\u2019s appeal, holding that the court lacked appellate jurisdiction and that the government \nwas not entitled to mandamus relief. Order at 1-2, No. 25-5025 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 12, 2015), ECF 9 \n(Katsas, Childs, Pan, JJ.). Judge Katsas issued a concurring opinion. See id. at 3. \nLater that night, the Court granted Special Counsel Dellinger\u2019s TRO application. Dellinger \nv. Bessent, No. 25 Civ. 385, 2025 WL 471022, at *2 (D.D.C. Feb 12, 2025). Consistent with \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 65, the Court limited its TRO to a fourteen-day period and \nscheduled a hearing on February 26 to decide whether to issue \u201can appealable preliminary \ninjunction.\u201d Id. at *14. The government responded to that order by filing a notice of appeal and a \nsecond emergency stay application in the D.C. Circuit. The government also filed a second stay \napplication before Your Honor, Mot. to Stay TRO Pending Appeal, No. 25 Civ. 385 (D.D.C. Feb. \n12, 2025), ECF 16, which the Court denied the next day, Order, No. 25 Civ. 385 (D.D.C. Feb. 13, \n2025), ECF 19. On Saturday, February 15, the Court issued a scheduling order consolidating \nconsideration of a preliminary injunction with consideration of the merits. Order, No. 25 Civ. 385 \n(D.D.C. Feb. 15, 2025, 4:27 PM).  \nThat evening, the D.C. Circuit denied the government\u2019s second motion for an emergency \nstay and dismissed its appeal, again finding that the government had failed to demonstrate appellate \njurisdiction or the propriety of mandamus relief. Order, No. 25-5028 (D.C. Cir. Feb 15, 2025), \nECF 9. Judge Katsas dissented. See id. at 16-27. The following morning, the government filed an \nemergency application asking the Supreme Court to vacate the TRO and enter an administrative \nstay. Application to Vacate, Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 24A790 (U.S. Feb. 16, 2025). Two days \nlater, Special Counsel Dellinger opposed that request. Opposition Brief, Dellinger v. Bessent, No. \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 23     Filed 02/24/25     Page 19 of 40\n24A790 (U.S. Feb. 18, 2025). On February 21, 2025, the Supreme Court issued an order holding \nthe stay application in abeyance until February 26, 2025, the day the TRO is currently scheduled \nto expire. Order, Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 24A790 (U.S. Feb. 21, 2025). Justices Sotomayor and \nJackson voted to deny the government\u2019s emergency application. Id. at 2. Justice Gorsuch, joined \nby Justice Alito, filed a dissenting opinion. Id. at 2 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting). \nMeanwhile, the parties proceeded with briefing in this Court. On February 20, Special \nCounsel Dellinger filed a reply in support of his motion for a preliminary injunction. See No. 25 \nCiv. 385 (D.D.C. Feb. 20, 2025), ECF 21. That motion remains pending. On February 21, the \ngovernment moved for summary judgment. See No. 25 Civ. 385 (D.D.C. Feb. 20, 2025), ECF 22. \nThis brief constitutes a response to that filing and a cross-motion for summary judgment.   \nLEGAL STANDARD \nA court \u201cshall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 56(a). A movant entitled to summary judgment may also obtain a permanent injunction by \ndemonstrating: \u201c(1) that [he] has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, \nsuch as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the \nbalance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) \nthat the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.\u201d Anatol Zukerman & \nCharles Krause Reporting, LLC v. U.S. Postal Serv., 64 F.4th 1354, 1364 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (quoting \neBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C., 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006)). Factors (3) and (4) merge when \nthe defendant is the government. Id. (citing Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009)). \n9 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 23     Filed 02/24/25     Page 20 of 40\nARGUMENT \nI.  Special Counsel Dellinger\u2019s Removal Was Unlawful \nThere is a single reason why Special Counsel Dellinger\u2019s motion for summary judgment \nshould be granted and the government\u2019s motion should be denied: the government did not comply \nwith an applicable and constitutional for-cause removal protection statute when it purported to \nterminate the Special Counsel. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b). There are no disputes of material fact that \nwould preclude the Court from deciding whether Special Counsel Dellinger\u2019s purported removal \nwas  unlawful.  Indeed,  the  government  has  conceded  that  Special  Counsel  Dellinger\u2019s \ntermination\u2014which did not reference any finding of \u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance \nin office\u201d\u2014violated \u00a7 1211(b). The government\u2019s position depends entirely on the premise that \u00a7 \n1211(b) violates the separation of powers under Seila Law, 591 U.S. 197, and Collins v. Yellen, \n594 U.S. 220 (2021). The Court can address that claim as a matter of law. In so doing, it should \nreject the government\u2019s position\u2014as it already did at the TRO stage. See Dellinger, 2025 WL \n471022, at *5 (\u201cThe Supreme Court has taken pains to carve the OSC out of its pronouncements \nconcerning the President\u2019s broad authority to remove officials who assist him in discharging his \nduties at will.\u201d); see also Order at 14, No. 25-5028 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 15, 2025), ECF 9 (\u201c[T]he cited \ncases do not hold that the President has unrestricted power to remove the Special Counsel.\u201d).  \nAs we will show, taken together, Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 \n(1935), Seila Law, and Collins all support the constitutionality of the OSC\u2019s for-cause removal \nlimitation. That is true for two independent reasons: (a) the Special Counsel is an inferior rather \nthan principal officer (and those cases all concerned principal officers); and (b) the central grounds \ngiven for invalidating for-cause removal restrictions in Seila Law and Collins do not apply here.  \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 23     Filed 02/24/25     Page 21 of 40\nA.  Special Counsel Dellinger Is an Inferior Officer \nFor inferior officers, Congress can \u201climit and restrict the power of removal as it deems best \nfor the public interest.\u201d United States v. Perkins, 116 U.S. 483, 485 (1886); see also Myers v. \nUnited States, 272 U.S. 52, 161-64 (1926); Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 689 n.27 (1988). The \nSupreme Court recognized that important distinction concerning inferior officers in Seila Law. See \n591 U.S. at 218-20. In assessing whether a given official is an inferior or principal officer, the key \nquestion is \u201cwhether he has a superior other than the President.\u201d United States v. Arthrex, Inc., 594 \nU.S. 1, 13 (2021) (cleaned up). Courts also consider the \u201cnature, scope, and duration of an officer\u2019s \nduties.\u201d Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 217 n.3 (citing Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, 661 (1997)). \nUnder that standard, the Special Counsel of the OSC is an inferior officer\u2014and Congress \nis thus freer to set terms for his removal from office. As explained above, the Special Counsel\u2019s \nrole is important but circumscribed. The OSC exercises what this Court has aptly described as \n\u201climited jurisdiction.\u201d Dellinger, 2025 WL 471022, at *8. In essence, he is an ombudsman. He \ncannot regulate or penalize (directly or indirectly) any private conduct. Within the world of federal \nemployment, moreover, he cannot impose any discipline or adverse action on his own authority. \nInstead, he receives complaints and encourages agencies to seek consensual resolutions; in some \ncases, he may also petition the MSPB on an injured employee\u2019s behalf or petition it to address a \npossible Hatch Act violation, but it is then up to the MSPB how it wishes to act on the petition. \nThe MSPB is \u201cfree to disagree with the Special Counsel and often does.\u201d AFGE, 747 F.2d at 753. \nThe Special Counsel can issue subpoenas while investigating, but he cannot actually enforce \nthem\u2014only the MSPB can do so. Similarly, although the Special Counsel can issue internal \nregulations and Hatch Act advisory opinions, they \u201cbind[] neither the public nor any agency or \nofficer of government.\u201d Id. at 752. The Special Counsel cannot bring an action in federal court. \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 23     Filed 02/24/25     Page 22 of 40\nNor can he conduct his own investigation of reports from employee-whistleblowers within \nagencies; for such cases, he only reviews and assesses investigations by the relevant agency.  \nIn these concrete respects, the Special Counsel\u2019s powers do not resemble the authority of \nthe principal officers who lead the CFPB and FHFA. The CFPB Director, for instance, wields the \npower to \u201cunilaterally . . . issue final regulations, oversee adjudications, set enforcement priorities, \ninitiate prosecutions, and determine what penalties to impose on private parties.\u201d Seila Law, 591 \nU.S. at 225. The FHFA Director, in turn, can \u201chold hearings,\u201d \u201csuspend corporate officers,\u201d \u201cbring \ncivil actions in federal court,\u201d and \u201cimpose penalties ranging from $2,000 to $2 million per day.\u201d \nCollins, 594 U.S. at 230. The Special Counsel lacks these kinds of executive authorities. Nor does \nthe Special Counsel\u2019s HR-oriented administrative functions compare to the criminal enforcement \npower wielded by U.S. Attorneys. As the Court knows well, U.S. Attorneys possess direct civil \nand criminal enforcement authority and wield immense power to directly and indirectly affect the \nrights, property, and liberty of private parties; they can bind and make representations on behalf \nof the federal Executive Branch; and they seek enforcement of their investigative subpoenas not \nfrom another independent agency of the Executive Branch, but rather from the Judiciary. The \nSpecial Counsel (and the OSC more generally) lacks any of those core executive prerogatives\u2014\nand most certainly lacks the authority to act coercively against third parties on its own prerogative.  \nAccordingly, the Special Counsel is properly considered an inferior officer under Supreme \nCourt precedent\u2014and the for-cause removal provision is thus lawful. The government disagrees, \nstating that inferior officers must have superiors \u201cother than the President.\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. 14 (quoting \nArthrex, 594 U.S. at 13).3 But in practice, the Special Counsel does have such superiors and \n \n3 \u201cGov\u2019t Br. __\u201d refers to the government\u2019s memorandum of law in support of its motion for \nsummary judgment, ECF 22. \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 23     Filed 02/24/25     Page 23 of 40\nsupervisors: he is effectively supervised by and accountable to the MSPB and the other federal \nagencies where whistleblowers raise concerns, since it is ultimately their decision whether and \nhow to accept his positions. Those agencies must exercise their independent discretion in assessing \nwhether to pursue the Special Counsel\u2019s recommendations and, in that sense, act as \u201cmanager[s] \nor overseer[s]\u201d of the OSC by deciding which actions by the OSC may proceed further. Supervisor, \nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary (12th ed. 2024); Supervisor, Oxford English Dictionary (2d ed. 1989) (\u201can \noverseer; a person who directs or oversees a task\u201d). As a commonsense matter, government \nofficials with limited authority and whose decisions are reviewable or modifiable by someone else \ninside the Executive Branch are not constitutional principal officers. See Vanda Pharms. Inc. v. \nFood & Drug Admin., No. 23 Civ. 2812, 2024 WL 4133623, at *19 (D.D.C. Sept. 10, 2024) \n(\u201c[I]nferior officers may issue binding resolutions so long as they are properly supervised by a \nsuperior with the power to direct and overrule their decisions.\u201d); Villarreal-Dancy v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of \nthe Air Force, No. 19 Civ. 2985, 2021 WL 3144942, at *9 n.5 (D.D.C. July 26, 2021). The Special \nCounsel entirely lacks authority to issue binding decisions, and any recommendation he makes, \nwhether that be to the MSPB or another agency head, is subject to the discretion of principal \nofficers. This intra-branch supervision means that the Special Counsel is not a principal officer.  \nThe government next claims that even if the Special Counsel is an inferior officer, Congress \nstill may not restrict his removal. Gov\u2019t Br. 14. Citing Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926), \nthe government states that if an inferior officer is sufficiently important to require the Senate\u2019s \nparticipation in his appointment, then the President must be able to fire him at will.  \nBut Myers concerned Congress\u2019s attempt to vest the removal power in Congress itself\u2014\nnot the imposition of modest limits on the President\u2019s ability to remove an official. 272 U.S. at \n107-08; see Morrison, 487 U.S. at 687 n.24 (\u201c[T]he only issue actually decided in Myers was that \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 23     Filed 02/24/25     Page 24 of 40\n\u2018the President had power to remove a postmaster of the first class, without the advice and consent \nof the Senate as required by act of Congress.\u2019\u201d (quoting Humphrey\u2019s Executor, 295 U.S. at 626)). \nThus, any \u201cgeneral language\u201d in Myers about Congress\u2019s ability to impose removal limitations \nshould be read \u201cas referring in context to circumstances similar to the circumstances then before \nthe  Court  and  not  referring  to  quite  different  circumstances  that  the  Court  was  not  then \nconsidering.\u201d Illinois v. Lidster, 540 U.S. 419, 424 (2004). Moreover, Myers itself also includes \ndicta inconsistent with the government\u2019s position. Specifically, Myers noted that, \u201c[t]o take away \nthis power of removal in relation to an inferior office created by statute, although that statute \nprovided for an appointment thereto by the President and confirmation by the Senate, would \nrequire very clear and explicit language. It should not be held to be taken away by mere inference \nor implication.\u201d Myers, 272 U.S. at 163 (quoting Shurtleff v. United States, 189 U.S. 311, 315 \n(1903)) (emphasis added). That is precisely the situation here: Congress used \u201cvery clear and \nexplicit language\u201d to create a for-cause removal protection. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b). And the \nSupreme Court has clarified that what matters in assessing the lawfulness of removal protections \nfor inferior officers is not the method of appointment, but whether the inferior officer \u201clack[s] \npolicymaking or significant administrative authority.\u201d Seila, 591 at 218 (quoting Morrison, 487 \nU.S. at 691)); Dellinger, 2025 WL 471022, at *6 (observing that \u201clike the independent counsel, \nplaintiff does not appear to have policymaking or significant administrative authority\u201d). The \nSpecial Counsel lacks any authority to make binding decisions. Therefore, under the law as set \nforth by the Supreme Court, the OSC\u2019s for-cause removal provision is valid.4   \n \n4 The government\u2019s view of these issues is not a model of consistency. Just days ago, the \ngovernment argued before Judge Chutkan that Elon Musk, the single-headed Administrator of the \nDepartment of Government Efficiency, is not a principal or inferior officer because he lacks \n\u201cformal authority to exercise the sovereign power of the United States\u201d and because his work \u201cis \na purely internal act of government\u201d in \u201ca preparatory step to inform some later action.\u201d Defs.\u2019 \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 23     Filed 02/24/25     Page 25 of 40\nB.  The Statutory Removal Protection Comports with Supreme Court Precedents \nAlternatively, even if Special Counsel Dellinger is a principal officer, the government\u2019s \nargument that \u00a7 1211 is unconstitutional under Seila Law and Collins fails because the OSC is \ndistinguishable from the agencies at issue in those cases\u2014the CFPB and FHFA\u2014in ways that \npowerfully support the continued constitutionality of its removal limitation. \nFirst, Seila Law and Collins were animated by a profound concern about the President\u2019s \ninability to remove officials sitting atop single-headed agencies that exercise core executive power \nin ways that could \u201cdictate and enforce policy for a vital segment of the economy affecting millions \nof Americans.\u201d Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 225; accord Collins, 594 U.S. at 255. In that scenario, even \n\u201cmodest restrictions\u201d on the President\u2019s removal authority may impede his ability to carry out his \nArticle II duties. Collins, 594 U.S. at 256 (quoting Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 228 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted)); see Gov\u2019t Br. 15. But here, that concern is not implicated: the OSC is an \nombudsman with limited advisory and reporting functions focused mainly on HR issues. In \nperforming these functions, the OSC does not regulate or penalize private activity. See Seila Law, \n591 U.S. at 221 (noting that the OSC \u201cdoes not bind private parties at all\u201d). The OSC also lacks \nthe power to issue binding regulations, oversee adjudications, commence prosecutions, determine \nwhat penalties to impose, proceed in an Article III tribunal, or control in any way the substantive \nregulatory framework for any public or private entities. Further, the OSC\u2019s authority to promulgate \nregulations is confined to nonbinding advisory opinions and internal OSC affairs. See AFGE, 747 \nF.2d at 752 (observing that such regulations \u201cbind[] neither the public nor any agency or officer \n \nResp. to Pls.\u2019 Revised Proposed TRO at 3-4, New Mexico v. Musk, No. 25 Civ. 429 (D.D.C. Feb. \n13, 2025), ECF 20. As set forth above, the Special Counsel, too, is limited to purely internal acts \nof government that may subsequently inform some later action by other agencies.  \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 23     Filed 02/24/25     Page 26 of 40\nof government\u201d). And only the MSPB, not the OSC, can issue decisions in administrative \nadjudications arising from the OSC\u2019s performance of its statutory duties.  \nThat is plainly not the type of \u201cregulatory and enforcement authority\u201d contemplated by the \nSupreme Court in Collins. 594 U.S. at 253; See Gov\u2019t Br. 15. Looking to the governing statutory \nframework\u2014rather than cherry-picked language from the OSC website\u2014the OSC\u2019s work occurs \nwithin a \u201climited jurisdiction\u201d related to federal employers and employees. Seila Law, 591 U.S. at \n221. As a matter of constitutional first principles, it poses no \u201cspecial threat to individual liberty\u201d \nfor the Special Counsel to receive limited independence from political control in reviewing and \npreliminarily investigating confidential whistleblower reports from federal employees. Id. at 223. \nSecond, consistent with the reasoning of Humphrey\u2019s Executor, the OSC exists to vindicate \nfunctions and interests held in common by Congress, the Executive Branch, and the public. \nCongress carefully designed the OSC to play an important reporting role with respect to legislative \noversight and deliberations. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1217. The OSC\u2019s work also furthers the distinct and \nshared inter-branch interest in promoting Executive Branch compliance with congressionally \nimposed  ethical  and  personnel  requirements  (although,  again,  not  through  issuing  binding \nregulations,  overseeing  adjudications,  or  commencing  prosecutions,  see  Gov\u2019t  Br.  15).  See \nDellinger, 2025 WL 471022, at *8 (\u201cThe agency\u2019s statutory functions require it to report directly \nto Congress about what it has found and whether any executive agency has stood in its way.\u201d).  In \nthat respect, the OSC is more than just an aspect of the executive power or extension of presidential \nwill. See Humphrey\u2019s Executor, 295 U.S. at 628. Moreover, the OSC\u2019s structure reflects a heavily \nnegotiated inter-branch resolution that was embraced by President Bush when he signed the \nWhistleblower Protection Act (and by his Attorney General in cooperating to pass the bill). In fact, \nnot  one,  but  two  Presidents\u2014Carter  and  Bush\u2014signed  legislation  with  for-cause  removal \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 23     Filed 02/24/25     Page 27 of 40\nprotections at the OSC, making clear that any interstitial concerns raised by their subordinates at \nthe OLC had either been addressed or overruled in practice by the Office of the President.5 \nFinally, the need for independence at the OSC is unique in its character and purposes. With \nrespect to the CFPB and FHFA, the case for agency independence rested heavily on a substantive \nbelief that economic regulation should be free of specific forms of presidential political control. \nSee Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 207; Collins, 594 U.S. at 229-30. Agency independence in those settings \nwas designed to restrain the President\u2019s ability to direct the agencies\u2019 regulatory powers consistent \nwith his agenda. Unfettered removal discretion in those circumstances served \u201cvital purposes.\u201d \nCollins, 594 U.S. at 252; see Gov\u2019t Br. 15. Here, in contrast, the OSC lacks any regulatory \npowers\u2014and the independence afforded by its statutory for-cause removal provisions serves an \nentirely different function. Rather than hamper the President\u2019s substantive regulatory agenda, the \nOSC\u2019s independence protects and assures whistleblowers, including those who may be reluctant \nto disclose potential wrongdoing to those in their own agencies. If the official charged with \nprotecting  whistleblowers  from  retaliation  was  himself  utterly  vulnerable  to  retaliation  and \nremoval for taking on politically charged or inconvenient cases, then the OSC\u2019s whistleblower \nprotection purpose might fail when it is most needed. Simply put, Congress reasonably found\u2014\nand two Presidents agreed\u2014that the Special Counsel cannot serve as an independent watchdog, or \nprotect  whistleblowers,  if  he  is  subject  at  all  times  to  removal  without  cause.  See,  e.g., \nConstitutionality of the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s Tenure Protection, 2021 WL 2981542, \n \n5 The government suggests that OLC opinions are a more accurate reflection of the Executive \nBranch\u2019s views than the positions taken by two Presidents. Whatever the virtue of that claim in \ngeneral, it is exceptionally weak here given President Bush\u2019s decision to single out the for-cause \nremoval  provision  while  declaring  that  negotiators  had  resolved  outstanding  constitutional \ndisagreements between the Executive and Congress in the Whistleblower Protection Act.  \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 23     Filed 02/24/25     Page 28 of 40\nat  *6  n.3,  *9  (O.L.C.  July  8,  2021)  (concluding  that  Collins  rendered  the  Social  Security \nCommissioner  removable  at-will  but  did  not  apply  to  the  OSC  by  virtue  of  its  \u201climited \njurisdiction\u201d). It is presumably for this very reason that \u201cSeila Law specifically distinguishes the \nOffice of Special Counsel in its analysis.\u201d Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5028, 2025 WL 559669, \nat *14 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 15, 2025); see Gov\u2019t Br. 15. \nAccordingly, the OSC\u2019s for-cause removal protection is constitutional.  \nII.  This Court Should Enter a Permanent Injunction \nNo genuine disputes of material fact prevent the Court from concluding that Special \nCounsel Dellinger satisfies the requirements for a permanent injunction. The government errs by \nclaiming that the Court has no authority to order the relief Special Counsel Dellinger seeks. \nMoreover, he has suffered irreparable harm from being denied his right to perform in office with \nthe removal protections given by Congress; monetary damages cannot compensate for that injury; \nand the balance of the equities and the public\u2019s interest also weigh firmly against the government.  \nA.  This Court Has Authority to Grant the Requested Relief  \nBefore even addressing the permanent-injunction factors, the government argues that this \nCourt lacks authority to grant the relief that Special Counsel Dellinger seeks. But a district court \nhas authority to grant declaratory and injunctive relief in this context\u2014including continuance and \nreinstatement remedies. See Severino v. Biden, 71 F.4th 1038, 1042-43 (D.C. Cir. 2023); Swan v. \nClinton, 100 F.3d 973, 979-80 (D.C. Cir. 1996). The government\u2019s contrary arguments fail. \nFirst, the government claims that Special Counsel Dellinger\u2019s requested relief would \nimpermissibly enjoin the President. Gov\u2019t Br. 19, 23. But Special Counsel Dellinger has sought a \ndeclaratory judgment, not injunctive relief, against the President. See Compl. at 13-14, No. 25 Civ. \n385 (D.D.C. Feb. 10, 2025), ECF 1. The D.C. Circuit has already recognized as much and noted \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 23     Filed 02/24/25     Page 29 of 40\nthat a court \u201ccan unquestionably review the legality of the President\u2019s action by enjoining the \nofficers who would attempt to enforce the President\u2019s order.\u201d Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5028, \n2025 WL 559669, at *6 n.1 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 15, 2025); see also id. (concluding that \u201cthe TRO is \nproperly read as not applying directly to the President but rather to the other defendants acting on \nhis behalf\u201d). Under binding D.C. Circuit precedent, this Court may provide effective relief to \nSpecial Counsel Dellinger by enjoining the same \u201csubordinate executive officials\u201d who are \nresponsible for implementing the President\u2019s attempted termination. Severino, 71 F.4th at 1042-\n43; Swan, 100 F.3d at 980; Dellinger, 2025 WL 559669, at *6 n.1. And this Court can also grant \ndeclaratory relief. See, e.g., Knight First Amend. Inst. v. Trump, 302 F. Supp. 3d 541, 579-80 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2018), aff\u2019d, 928 F.3d 226 (2d Cir. 2019), vacated as moot, 141 S. Ct. 1220 (2021) \n(granting declaratory relief and noting that \u201call government officials are presumed to follow the \nlaw once the judiciary has said what the law is\u201d)  \nSecond, the government claims that courts generally lack the power in equity (or otherwise) \nto reinstate unlawfully removed officials. Gov\u2019t Br. 17-18. To the extent this argument is focused \non principal officers, it falls short because the Special Counsel is an inferior officer. See supra I.A. \nThe government\u2019s argument is also flawed in several additional respects.6 \nTo start, Special Counsel Dellinger does not seek (and this Court has not provided for) \n\u201creinstatement\u201d to  the  office of Special Counsel. Rather, his position is that his purported \ntermination without cause on February 7, 2025, was void ab initio. See Harris v. Bessent, No. 25 \n \n6 In suggesting otherwise\u2014in a dissent that was itself fairly tentative\u2014Justice Gorsuch had not \nreceived briefing on many of the authorities set forth here (since the government meaningfully \ndeveloped its arguments on this point for the first time only at the Supreme Court, which meant \nthat neither this Court nor the D.C. Circuit nor Special Counsel Dellinger had much opportunity \nbefore emergency filings at the Supreme Court to properly research and address the issue). \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 23     Filed 02/24/25     Page 30 of 40\nCiv. 412, 2025 WL 521027, at *8 (D.D.C. Feb. 18, 2025) (\u201cDefendants thus conflate wrongful \ntermination with the lack of power to effectuate termination\u2014at least without cause.\u201d). Special \nCounsel Dellinger therefore seeks a declaration that his February 7 termination was unlawful and \nan order against subordinate executive officials to provide him the privileges and authorities of the \nSpecial Counsel, which would extend the relief this Court already provided in its TRO.

Gov\u2019t Br. 17-19. Nothing precludes a court \nfrom ordering such relief. See Laurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 706 n.20 (3d ed. \n2000) (explaining that \u201can injunction could issue to bar unlawful removal and . . . an appropriate \nsubordinate could be required by mandamus to reinstate an unlawfully removed officer\u201d). Courts \nin this Circuit have accordingly ordered reinstatement of officers (or prevented their unlawful \nremoval) across the Executive Branch. See Berry v. Reagan, No. 83-3182, 1983 WL 538, at *5 \n(D.D.C. Nov. 14, 1983) (granting preliminary injunction against removal of plaintiffs as members \nof the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights), vacated as moot, 732 F.2d 949 (D.C. Cir. 1983); Mackie, \n809 F.

Cir. 1963) (holding \nthat plaintiff is \u201centitled to reinstatement\u201d); Paroczay, 219 F. Supp. at 94. \nHistory confirms the Court\u2019s authority to order restoration of invalidly removed officers. \nFor centuries, courts acting under the writ of mandamus have ordered plaintiffs be restored to \npublic offices from which they were wrongfully removed. See, e.g., Thomas Tapping, The Law \n \n8 The government tries to distinguish Swan because it addresses the question of Article III standing, \nbut this attempted distinction misunderstands Swan\u2019s relevance. Gov\u2019t Br. 19 n.4. Swan held, after \nsurveying caselaw on the authority of courts to enjoin the President, that the court had authority to \nissue adequate relief even absent an injunction requiring \u201cofficial reinstatement by the President.\u201d \n100 F.3d at 980. That is exactly the kind of relief that Special Counsel Dellinger seeks. Separately, \nthe court concluded that the officer at issue was not protected by any express for-cause removal \nprovision. Id. at 981. But \u00a7 1211(b) provides such express protection for the Special Counsel. \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 23     Filed 02/24/25     Page 32 of 40\nand Practice of the High Prerogative Writ of Mandamus as it Obtains Both in England and in \nIreland 221 (1853) (\u201cThe writ of mandamus . . . has been by a great number of cases held to be \ngrantable, as well to admit him who has a right as to restore him who has been wrongfully \ndisplaced, to any office . . . .\u201d); John Shortt, Informations (Criminal and Quo Warranto), \nMandamus and Prohibitions 302 (1888) (identifying \u201cmandamus to restore\u201d as a remedy available \nto  plaintiffs  \u201cwrongfully  dispossessed  of  any  office\u201d);  Samuel  Slaughter  Merrill,  Law  of \nMandamus \u00a7 148 (1892) (\u201cWhen an officer has been wrongfully removed from his office, he will \nbe restored thereto by the writ of mandamus.\u201d). And courts of law have similarly recognized \nproceedings in quo warranto as \u201ca plain, speedy, and adequate\u201d remedy in law \u201cfor trying the title \nto office.\u201d Delgado v. Chavez, 140 U.S. 586, 590 (1891); see also, e.g., Newman v. United States \nex rel. Frizzell, 238 U.S. 537, 544 (1915) (\u201cThe writ thus came to be used as a means of \ndetermining which of two claimants was entitled to an office .... \u201d). This longstanding procedure \nvests courts with the traditional remedial authority \u201cnot only to oust the respondent [officer] but \nalso to install the relator [officer].\u201d Floyd R. Mechem, A Treatise on the Law of Public Offices and \nOfficers \u00a7 496 (1890); e.g., Boyd v. Nebraska, 143 U.S. 135, 151 (1892); United States ex rel. \nCrawford v. Addison, 73 U.S. 291, 297 (1867) (observing that upon judgment of ouster, \u201crelator \nthereupon became entitled to the office\u201d). \nThe cases cited by the government confirm rather than undermine this point. See In re \nSawyer, 124 U.S. 200 (1888); White v. Berry, 171 U.S. 366 (1898). As the Supreme Court wrote \nin Sawyer, \u201cThe jurisdiction to determine the title to a public office . . . is exercised either by . . . \nmandamus, prohibition, quo warranto, or information in the nature of a writ of quo warranto, \naccording to . . . the mode of procedure, established by the common law or by statute.\u201d Sawyer, \n124 U.S. at 212; see also id. at 213, 216, 220 (same); White, 171 U.S. at 377 (identifying \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 23     Filed 02/24/25     Page 33 of 40\n\u201cmandamus, prohibition, quo warranto, or information in the nature of a writ of quo warranto\u201d). \nThe government\u2019s other authorities say the same, or rested on the conceptually distinct point that \nfederal courts should abstain from adjudicating state offices. See, e.g., Walton v. House of \nRepresentatives of State of Okl., 265 U.S. 487, 490 (1924) (eligibility of state representative); \nHarkrader v. Wadley, 172 U.S. 148, 165 (1898) (declining to enjoin state criminal proceeding). \n  To be sure, the government tries to disclaim quo warranto as a relevant analogue on the \nbasis that it has been historically viewed as a \u201clegal rather than an equitable remedy.\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. \n18. But the Supreme Court in Sawyer and White divided legal and equitable remedies because \nthose cases were \u201cdecided before the simplification of the rules of pleading and, more importantly, \nbefore the merger of law and equity.\u201d Stern v. S. Chester Tube Co., 390 U.S. 606, 608-10 (1968). \nNow, \u201cthere is only one action . . . in which all claims may be joined and all remedies are \navailable.\u201d Ross v. Bernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 539 (1970). Further, in the 100-plus years since \nSawyer and White were decided, the Supreme Court has approved court-ordered reinstatements to \npositions in the Executive Branch. See, e.g., Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592, 604-05 (1988) \n(rejecting government\u2019s position that, on remand, courts lacked authority to \u201corder respondent\u2019s \nreinstatement,\u201d approvingly citing \u201ctraditional equitable principles\u201d); Vitarelli v. Seaton, 359 U.S. \n535, 546 (1959) (holding Department of the Interior employee \u201cis entitled to the reinstatement \nwhich he seeks\u201d). And the government\u2019s categorical \u201cno-reinstatement\u201d rule cannot be reconciled \nwith the Supreme Court\u2019s later recognition that, where warranted, courts have \u201cinjunctive power\u201d \nto reinstate executive employees. Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 92 n.68 (1974). There is thus \nno present-day basis for the government\u2019s antiquated view of pleadings and remedies.9  \n \n9 In the same vein, the government does not contest the courts\u2019 authority to adjudicate the title to \npublic office under quo warranto but objects that Special Counsel Dellinger did not plead quo \nwarranto in his complaint. Gov\u2019t Br. 18. However, in cases involving removal from office, \u201cthe \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 23     Filed 02/24/25     Page 34 of 40\nNor does the government succeed in deriving a \u201cbackpay-only\u201d rule from a handful of prior \ncases involving removed officers. A litigant\u2019s choices about what remedy to seek in prior litigation \ntactics have nothing to do with the court\u2019s authority to issue a remedy. In any event, one analogous \nlitigant (Myron Wiener) originally did sue for reinstatement, and filed suit for backpay only after \nCongress\u2019s abolition of the War Claims Commission mooted his request to be reinstated to it. \nWiener v. United States, 357 U.S. 349, 350 (1958); Br. for United States, 1957 WL 87809, at *13-\n14 (Oct. 15, 1957). As to Mr. Humphrey, the government does not dispute that he was dead when \na legal challenge to his removal was first filed. See Humphrey\u2019s Executor, 295 U.S. at 612; see \nGov\u2019t Br. 16 n.3. Were there doubt, the parties\u2019 briefs confirm this timing. Br. for Executor, 1935 \nWL 32964, at *2-3 (Mar. 19, 1935) (explaining that Humphrey\u2019s estate first challenged his \nremoval on April 28, 1934, two months after his death). And Mr. Myers\u2014who was deceased at \nthe time of a final judgment\u2014saw his term of office expire in July 1921, only months after he first \nsued and years before the trial court heard his case. See Myers v. United States, 58 Ct. Cl. 199, \n202-03 (1923), aff\u2019d, 272 U.S. 52 (1926). Reinstatement would have been moot at that point. \nAccordingly, the government\u2019s effort to craft a back-pay-only rule from these cases ignores the \nfacts and context of these proceedings. \nNext, the government disputes the Court\u2019s remedial authority on the ground that there is \nno \u201cprevious case in which a court ordered the reinstatement of single agency head after removal \n \nCourt is to broadly construe\u201d the request for relief, Severino v. Biden, 581 F. Supp. 3d 110, 116 \n(D.D.C. 2022), aff\u2019d, 71 F.4th 1038 (D.C. Cir. 2023), and may grant any remedy necessary to \naccord the plaintiff relief (or may instead grant leave to amend), Swan, 100 F.3d at 980. Moreover, \nD.C. Code \u00a7 16-3501 expressly authorizes Special Counsel Dellinger as an \u201cinterested person\u201d to \nseek a writ from this court. See Newman, 238 U.S. at 546 (distinguishing between a \u201cthird person\u201d \nand \u201cinterested person\u201d). A prior request to the U.S. Attorney General would have been both futile \nand inadequate. See, e.g., Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 326-27 (1988); see Gov\u2019t Br. 18. \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 23     Filed 02/24/25     Page 35 of 40\nby the President.\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. 18. But there have not been any such cases involving an official \nremoved without cause, principally because Presidents have not historically violated for-cause \nremoval restrictions. Of course, President Biden removed the Commissioner of the Social Security \nAdministration, but the removed commissioner did not choose to contest that determination in \ncourt (perhaps because the OLC\u2019s position after Collins\u2014a position that distinguished the OLC\u2014\nseemed likely to prevail if tested in the Judiciary). See Constitutionality of the Commissioner of \nSocial Security\u2019s Tenure Protection, 2021 WL 2981542, at *6 n.3, *9 (O.L.C. July 8, 2021). Any \nabsence of on-point authority thus cuts both ways and certainly does not support the government.  \nRegardless, the more sensible lesson to derive from past practice is that reinstatement \nremedies have long been perceived as inherent and integral to the statutory framework for \nindependent agencies. As explained above, Special Counsel Dellinger challenges his removal by \nreference to a statutory provision that seeks to secure a measure of agency independence from \ndirect political control. See Dellinger, 2025 WL 471022, at *6. It is appropriate for this Court to \ncraft equitable remedies by reference to that statutory scheme. See CIGNA Corp. v. Amara, 563 \nU.S.  421,  444-45  (2011)  (defining  the  district  court\u2019s  remedy  by  reference  to  \u201cequitable \nprinciples[] as modified by the obligations and injuries identified by ERISA itself\u201d); Porter v. \nWarner Holding Co., 328 U.S. 395, 398 (1946) (\u201c[S]ince the public interest is involved in a \nproceeding of this nature, those equitable powers assume an even broader and more flexible \ncharacter than when only a private controversy is at stake.\u201d); Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.S. 321, \n331 (1944) (\u201c[D]iscretion under [the statutory provision authorizing relief\u200a] must be exercised in \nlight of the large objectives of the\u201d statute, \u201c[f\u200a]or the standards of the public interest[,] not the \nrequirements of private litigation[,] measure the propriety and need for injunctive relief in these \ncases.\u201d). Attention to the statutory scheme, in turn, clarifies the proper remedial framework. In \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 23     Filed 02/24/25     Page 36 of 40\ndesigning the OSC, Congress undertook to safeguard covered officials against removal without \ncause. It follows from this statutory plan that officials removed without cause can seek a judicial \norder (just like the one issued here) providing for their continuance in the relevant office. \nTo hold otherwise would reduce for-cause removal statutes to rubble. On the government\u2019s \nview, a President could fire independent agency officials at will and, at most, months or years later, \nafter final judgment and appeal, those fired officials might be able to recover some backpay from \nthe Treasury . . . but nothing more. On this logic, a century of ink and energy devoted to agency \nindependence has been a colossal misadventure: all it would cost is a few thousand dollars from \nthe U.S. Treasury for a President to buy his way out of for-cause removal restrictions. Rather than \ninfer that so many Presidents, legislators, courts, scholars, and agency officials misunderstood how \nfor-cause removal restrictions work\u2014namely, to keep covered officials in office unless they are \nproperly terminated\u2014the more natural inference is that equity permits courts to afford continuance \nor reinstatement remedies as necessary to effectuate these longstanding statutory safeguards.  \nFinally, and alternatively, even if the government is correct that this Court cannot issue \nan order against subordinate executive officials to provide Special Counsel Dellinger with the \nprivileges and authorities of the Special Counsel, partial summary judgment would still be \nappropriate. First, the Court could still issue a declaratory judgment that Hampton Dellinger is the \nproper head of the OSC. See, e.g., United States v. Wilson, 290 F.3d 347, 362 (D.C. Cir. 2002) \n(declaring that appellee \u201cis a member of the United States Commission on Civil Rights \u2018with all \nthe powers, privileges, and emoluments thereunto of right appertaining\u2019\u201d); Borak v. Biddle, 141 \nF.2d 278, 281 (D.C. Cir. 1944); see also Nat\u2019l Treasury Emps. Union v. Nixon, 492 F.2d 587, 616 \n(D.C. Cir. 1974) (issuing a declaratory judgment against the President); Clinton v. City of New \nYork, 524 U.S. 417, 433 n.22 (1998) (an action \u201ctraceable to the President\u2019s\u201d decisions \u201cwould be \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 23     Filed 02/24/25     Page 37 of 40\nredressed by a declaratory judgment that the [actions] are invalid\u201d). Second, and once again \nseparate of the requested injunctive and declaratory relief, this Court may award Special Counsel \nDellinger backpay, which would require it to hold that his termination was unlawful. Compl. 14. \nB.  The Permanent Injunction Factors Strongly Favor Relief \nSpecial Counsel Dellinger has previously explained the irreparable harms he would suffer \nin both his personal and official capacities if he is removed from office: most notably, he would \nbe deprived of the statutory right to function in his office, and deprivation of that statutory right \nwould cause immeasurable and irreparable damage to the OSC at this especially fraught time for \nthe federal civil service. E.g., ECF 12 at 4-7; ECF 21 at 9. In its opinion granting the TRO, this \nCourt thoroughly addressed each of those harms and explained in detail why the government\u2019s \nauthority did not carry the day. Dellinger, 2025 WL 471022, at *9-13. Since that decision, Judge \nContreras has followed this Court\u2019s careful analysis to reach a similar finding of irreparable harm \nto a member of the MSPB removed in violation of an express for-cause removal protection. See \nHarris v. Bessent, No. 25 Civ. 412, 2025 WL 521027, at *6-9 (D.D.C. Feb. 18, 2025). \nThe government does not refute the Court\u2019s analysis; instead, it mostly repeats the same \npoints that this Court has already rejected. Compare Gov\u2019t Br. 20-21, with Dellinger, 2025 WL \n471022, at *9-13 (addressing Sampson, Berry, and English). The government\u2019s sole new argument \nis to analogize Special Counsel Dellinger\u2019s deprivation of the statutory right to function in his \noffice to suits filed by small numbers of congressional representatives in which courts rejected a \ntheory of Article III \u201clegislative standing.\u201d See Gov\u2019t Br. 20 (citing Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, \n820 (1997); Barnes v. Kline, 759 F.2d 21, 50 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (Bork, J., dissenting)). But those \ncases do not stand for the broad principle that a public official can never sue to vindicate an \nirreparable institutional injury on behalf of a government office. Rather, they stand for the much \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 23     Filed 02/24/25     Page 38 of 40\nnarrower proposition that individual representatives in a legislative body generally lack standing \nto vindicate the institutional interests of the whole body. See Ariz. State Legislature v. Ariz. Indep. \nRedistricting Comm\u2019n, 576 U.S. 787, 802-04 (2015); see Comm. on Judiciary of U.S. House of \nRepresentatives v. McGahn, 968 F.3d 755, 763-66 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (en banc). Here, in contrast, \nSpecial Counsel Dellinger was appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate to lead the \nOSC, and so is uniquely situated to vindicate his office\u2019s statutory right to function with a modest \ndegree of independence. The government\u2019s further argument that Special Counsel Dellinger has \nno right to exercise authority absent presidential approval, Gov\u2019t Br. 20, rests on the predicate \nassumption that it will prevail on the merits. As discussed above, the government is wrong. \nFurther, as this Court has concluded, a post-judgment award of monetary damages would \nbe an inadequate remedy for Special Counsel Dellinger\u2019s irreparable loss of his statutory right to \nfunction in office: \u201c[P]laintiff\u2019s irreparable injury cannot be compared to the loss of income or \nembarrassment involved in the typical employment action, for which there are remedies that do \nnot involve equitable relief. This case falls outside of the typical paradigm since the OSC is an \nindependent agency and the White House is not plaintiff\u2019s employer.\u201d Dellinger, 2025 471022, at \n*10; see also Sampson, 415 U.S. at 86 n.58, 92 n.68 (explaining that monetary damages alone \nwould be inadequate in \u201cextraordinary\u201d cases outside \u201croutine\u201d loss of employment). \nFinally, the balance of the equities and the public interest strongly favor the relief sought \nby Special Counsel Dellinger. The government asserts a \u201cgreat and irreparable harm to the \nExecutive,\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. 21, but that same reasoning has not yet carried the day in any court to hear \nthe case\u2014and is unconvincing on its terms, since it amounts to a restatement of the government\u2019s \nview of the merits of the case, rather than a distinct explanation for why its position is correct. On \nthe flip side of the equation, \u201c[t]here is generally no public interest in the perpetuation of unlawful \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 23     Filed 02/24/25     Page 39 of 40\nagency action.\u201d League of Women Voters of United States v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. \n2016). Instead, there is a \u201csubstantial public interest\u201d in the Executive Branch abiding by federal \nlaw. Id. at 12; Harris, 2025 WL 521027, at *9 (same). \nThe government separately argues that reinstating Special Counsel Dellinger\u2014who was \nlawfully appointed and confirmed to his office\u2014would cause confusion that could later invalidate \nactions by the OSC. Gov\u2019t Br. 22-23 (citing Collins, 594 U.S. at 259). But in light of the OSC\u2019s \nnarrow jurisdiction and inability to regulate private parties, it is unclear who the government thinks \ncould file suit to invalidate the OSC\u2019s actions (as a private party did in Collins). Regardless, any \nfault for confusion over the OSC\u2019s authority rests with the government, which refuses to comply \nwith the plain terms of a 50-year-old statute. See Dellinger, 2025 WL 471022, at *10 & n.5; Order \nat 1, No. 25 Civ. 385 (D.D.C. Feb. 13, 2025), ECF 19. \nThe public interest in enforcing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b) is particularly strong today. Congress \nestablished the Special Counsel to protect whistleblowers and federal employees victimized by \nprohibited personnel practices. As Congress and two Presidents recognized, \u201c[i]ndependence is \nessential to any Special Counsel\u2019s ability to perform the unique set of duties and reporting \nrequirements set forth in the statute.\u201d Dellinger, 2025 WL 471022, at *13. That independence has \nnever  been  more  important  given  the  historic  upheaval  currently  occurring  within  federal \nemployment and the continued need to ensure that whistleblowers are guarded from reprisal. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons above, Special Counsel Dellinger\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment \nshould be granted, the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment should be denied, and the \nCourt should issue declaratory and permanent injunctive relief to Special Counsel Dellinger. \n  \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 23     Filed 02/24/25     Page 40 of 40\n  Respectfully submitted,  \n \n \n    /s/ Joshua A.

Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau, 591 U.S. \n197, 203 (2020).  The executive power encompasses the authority to remove those who aid the \nPresident in carrying out his duties.  These principles have led the Supreme Court and courts of appeals \nto affirm that the President can remove at will the heads of all other executive branch agencies with a \nsingle leader.  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 205 (CFPB); Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. at 228 (2021) (FHFA); \nRodriguez v. SSA, 118 F.4th 1302, 1313-14 (11th Cir. 2024) (SSA); Kaufmann v. Kijakazi, 32 F.4th 843, \n848-49 (9th Cir. 2022) (SSA).  As Defendants explained in their motion for summary judgment, like \nthose other single-head agencies, the President may lawfully remove the sole head of the Office of \nSpecial Counsel (OSC) at will.  See Defs.\u2019 Mot. for Summ. J. (\u201cDef.\u2019s Mot.) at 6-15, ECF 22. \n  In his cross-motion for summary judgment, see Pl.\u2019s Cross-Mot. for Summ. J. & Opp\u2019n to \nGov\u2019t Mot. for Summ. J. (Pl.\u2019s Mot.), ECF No. 23, Plaintiff now contends that the Special Counsel \nfalls within a narrow exception to the President\u2019s removal power for inferior officers, or officers who \nare \u201cdirected and supervised at some level by others who were appointed by Presidential nomination \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 25     Filed 02/25/25     Page 2 of 13\nwith the advice and consent of the Senate.\u201d  Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, 662 (1997).  But as \nthe head of the Office of Special Counsel, a freestanding executive branch agency exercising core \nexecutive power, the Special Counsel is directed and supervised by nobody other than the President. \nHe is definitionally a principal officer. \n  As to remedy, Plaintiff also advances several arguments to try to circumvent the longstanding \nprinciple that courts cannot enjoin the President.  But Plaintiff cannot escape the nature of his \nrequested remedy:  Any injunction that restrains the President\u2019s ability to appoint his preferred head \nof OSC and his ability to remove an officer in whom he lacks confidence is an equitable remedy that \nruns against the President.  Moreover, Plaintiff\u2019s other arguments run headlong into Supreme Court \nprecedent holding that a federal court\u2019s inherent equitable authority is limited to those equitable \npowers traditionally available at the Founding.  Reinstatement of a principal officer was not among \nthese remedies.  Nor does Plaintiff meaningfully contend otherwise. \n  Because Plaintiff has failed to demonstrate he is entitled to relief, the Court should grant \nsummary judgment in favor of Defendants and deny Plaintiff\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment. \nARGUMENT \nI.  The President Lawfully Removed Plaintiff as Head of the Office of Special Counsel.  \nA.  Plaintiff Is Not An Inferior Officer. \nSeemingly recognizing the weakness of his claim that the President\u2019s at-will removal authority \nover single agency heads cannot be lawfully constrained, Plaintiff changes tack and primarily relies on \nan argument he did not even raise in his motion for a preliminary injunction:  that he is an inferior \nrather than principal officer.  As Defendants explained in their motion for summary judgment, see \nDef.\u2019s Mot. at 14, that is clearly incorrect. \n\u201cWhether one is an \u2018inferior\u2019 officer depends on whether he has a superior.\u201d  Edmond, 520 U.S. \nat 662.  The Supreme Court has held that \u201c\u2018inferior officers\u2019 are officers whose work is directed and \nsupervised at some level by others who were appointed by Presidential nomination with the advice \nand consent of the Senate.\u201d  Id. at 663; accord United States v. Arthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. 1, 13 (2021).   Plaintiff \nis not \u201cdirected and supervised\u201d by anyone other than the President.  He is appointed by the President \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 25     Filed 02/25/25     Page 3 of 13\nalone, and he can be removed by the President alone.  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b).  He is not subordinate to \nany other officer.  See Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 719 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\u201cAt the only \nother point in the Constitution at which the word \u2018inferior\u2019 appears, it plainly connotes a relationship \nof subordination.\u201d); see also id. at 721 (\u201cNor are any of the other cases cited by the Court in support of \nits view inconsistent with the natural reading that an inferior officer must at least be subordinate to \nanother officer of the United States.\u201d). \nPlaintiff is also the head of a distinct agency\u2014a position that cannot be anything other than a \nprincipal officer.  As Plaintiff himself puts it, the Office of Special Counsel is \u201can independent federal \nagency.\u201d  Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 1.  The Office began as part of the MSPB, but in 1989, Congress chose to make \nthe Office a freestanding agency.  See Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-12, 103 \nStat. 16.  OSC is a \u201cfree-standing, self-contained entity in the Executive Branch\u201d that is \u201cnot \nsubordinate to or contained within any other such component,\u201d Free Enter. Fund v. Public Company \nAccounting Oversight Board, 561 U.S. 477, 511 (2010).  The statute establishes that the \u201cOffice of Special \nCounsel . . . shall be headed by the Special Counsel.\u201d  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(a).  That means OSC is an \nExecutive Department, and as the head of a Department, Plaintiff is a principal officer.  See U.S. Const. \nArt. II \u00a7 2, cl. 2 (vesting the power to appoint inferior Officers in \u201cthe Heads of Departments\u201d).   \nFurther, as the Head of a Department, the Special Counsel is authorized to appoint other \ninferior officers.  Id.; 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1212(d)(1) (authorizing the Special Counsel to make appointments).  \nIndeed, Congress\u2019 choice to make the Special Counsel the Head of a Department represents a \u201csharp \ndistinction between\u201d his status as a \u201cprincipal officer[] and [other] inferior officers.\u201d  Freytag v. \nCommissioner, 501 U.S. 868, 919 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment); \naccord Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 510-13 (endorsing the Freytag concurrence).  And in its brief in Seila \nLaw, the House of Representatives assumed that the Special Counsel was a principal officer in \ncomparing him to the CFPB Director, who no party disputed was a principal officer.  See Brief for \nAmicus Curiae the U.S. House of Representatives at 25-26, Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 2020 WL 487328 \n(U.S., Jan. 22, 2020) (\u201c[P]etitioner and the Solicitor General assert that the combination of a for-cause \nremoval protection with a single-director structure is suspect because it is \u201cnovel.\u201d  Petr. Br. 22-24; \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 25     Filed 02/25/25     Page 4 of 13\nSG Br. 32-35.  But that combination has existed for decades.  Congress gave the head of the Office \nof Special Counsel for-cause removal protection more than forty years ago.  Civil Service Reform Act \nof 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, \u00a7 202(a), 92 Stat. 1122.  The Social Security Administration and the \nFederal Housing Finance Agency also combine these characteristics.  ACUS Sourcebook 48-49.\u201d). \nPlaintiff does not identify a single case holding that the sole head of an agency is an inferior \nofficer.    Instead,  he  primarily  contends  that  because  the  Special Counsel  has  \u201ccircumscribed\u201d \nauthority, he cannot be a principal officer.  Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 11-12.  But that inquiry is relevant only to \nwhether Plaintiff is an officer at all, not whether he is an inferior officer.  See Lucia v. Sec. & Exch. \nComm\u2019n, 585 U.S. 237, 245 (2018) (one element of test for distinguishing between \u201cofficers and \nemployees\u201d is whether the official exercises \u201csignificant authority\u201d).  What matters for present \npurposes is whether the officer is supervised by someone other than the President, and he is not.1  In \nany event, even Plaintiff\u2019s premise is wrong.  As Justice Gorsuch explained, the Special Counsel \n\u201cwields significant prosecutorial and investigative power as the sole head of a 129-person office.\u201d  \nOrder at 4, Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 24A790 (U.S. Feb. 21, 2025) (Gorsuch, J., dissenting); see also Dellinger \nv. Bessent, No. 25-5028, 2025 WL 559669, at *11 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 15, 2025) (Katsas, J., dissenting) (the \nSpecial Counsel exercises \u201cbroad investigative and enforcement powers.\u201d); Def.\u2019s Mot. at 9-10.   \nPlaintiff also argues that the Special Counsel is \u201ceffectively\u201d supervised by the MSPB.  Pl.\u2019s \nMot. at 13.  But that makes no sense: The Special Counsel is not \u201csupervised\u201d by the MSPB any more \nthan the Solicitor General is \u201csupervised\u201d by the Supreme Court.  Plaintiff provides no statutory \nprovision indicating that the Special Counsel reports to, or is any way directed by, the MSPB.  This is \nunsurprising, since the Special Counsel \u201cperform[s] his vested responsibilities without any direction \nfrom the Board.\u201d  Presidential Appointees-Removal Power-Civ. Serv. Reform Act-Const. L. (Article II, S 2, Cl. \n2), 2 U.S. Op. Off. Legal Counsel 120, 121 (1978).  As OLC explained, \u201c[t]he Special Counsel has a \n \n1 For this reason, Plaintiff\u2019s cases\u2014none of which involves the head of an agency\u2014are inapposite.  \nSee Vanda Pharms. Inc. v. Food & Drug Admin., No. 23 Civ. 2812, 2024 WL 4133623, at *18 (D.D.C. \nSept. 10, 2024) (discussing authority of subordinate official in the U.S. Department of Health and \nHuman Services, who was appointed by the Secretary); Villarreal-Dancy v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Air Force, \nNo. 19 Civ. 2985, 2021 WL 3144942, at *8-*9 (D.D.C. July 26, 2021) (explaining that the Air Force \nBoard for Correction of Military Records is subordinate to the Air Force Secretary). \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 25     Filed 02/25/25     Page 5 of 13\nstatus independent of and apart from the Board.\u201d  Memorandum Opinion for the General Counsel, Civil \nService Commission, 2 Op. O.L.C. 120, 121 (1978).  Indeed, the relationship Plaintiff describes between \nthe Special Counsel and MSPB is nothing more than \u201cthe same relation . . . as Federal prosecutors \nbear to the Federal courts.\u201d  Id. at 122.  The powers that Plaintiff references in support of his \ncontention  that  the  MSPB  supervises  the  Special  Counsel  are  just  like  those  of  prosecutors:  \nprosecutors cannot \u201cimpose any discipline . . . on [their] own authority,\u201d Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 11, prosecutors \ncannot \u201cactually enforce [subpoenas]\u201d without going to a court, id., and a court is \u201cfree to disagree \nwith [prosecutors],\u201d id. (citing Am. Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Emps., AFL-CIO v. O\u2019Connor, 747 F.2d 748, 753 (D.C. \nCir. 1984)).2  It is certainly not the case that a prosecutor is \u201cdirected and supervised\u201d by a court.  See \nEdmond, 520 U.S. at 662. \nPlaintiff argues, without citation, that he is an inferior officer because he cannot \u201cconduct his \nown investigation of reports from employee-whistleblowers within agencies.\u201d  Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 12.  But \nthe Special Counsel does not need approval from an agency head before initiating an investigation.  \nRather, the Special Counsel is authorized to \u201cinvestigate [an] allegation to the extent necessary to \ndetermine whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice has \noccurred, exists, or is to be taken.\u201d  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1214(a)(1)(A).  And even \u201cin the absence of an \nallegation,\u201d the Special Counsel has the power to \u201cconduct an investigation for the purpose of \ndetermining whether there are reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice (or \na pattern of prohibited personnel practices) has occurred, exists, or is to be taken.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1214(a)(5).  \nPlaintiff also misleadingly suggests that other federal agencies must \u201cexercise their independent \ndiscretion in assessing whether to pursue the Special Counsel\u2019s recommendations\u201d and that \u201cany \nrecommendation he makes . . . is subject to\u201d their discretion.  Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 13.  To the contrary, the \nSpecial Counsel has express authority to initiate an enforcement action before the MSPB if an agency \ndoes not take action in response to the Special Counsel\u2019s recommendations.  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1214(a)(2)(C). \n \n2 Am. Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Emps., AFL-CIO v. O\u2019Connor, which Plaintiff relies on several times for his assertion \nthat the Special Counsel exercises only limited authority, involved a non-binding advisory opinion \nissued by a subordinate to the Special Counsel, 747 F.2d at 751-53, not any of the Special Counsel\u2019s \nother, sweeping investigatory and prosecutorial powers. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 25     Filed 02/25/25     Page 6 of 13\nFinally, Plaintiff misreads Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926).  See Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 13-14.  \nPlaintiff\u2019s cited portion of Myers merely recited the proposition from Shurtleff v. United States that as a \nmatter of statutory interpretation, Congress must speak with \u201cvery clear and explicit language\u201d to \nrestrict the President\u2019s removal power.  189 U.S. 311, 315 (47 L. Ed. 828).  Myers held that the President \ncan remove inferior officers whom he appointed.  272 U.S. at 161-62; see id. at 162 (\u201cIf [Congress] \ndoes not choose to intrust the appointment of such inferior officers to less authority than the President \nwith the consent of the Senate, it has no power of providing for their removal.\u201d).  And the Court in \nSeila Law limited the exception to the President\u2019s \u201cunrestricted removal power\u201d for inferior officers \nto only those \u201cwith limited duties and no policymaking or administrative authority.\u201d  591 U.S. at 204, \n218.  As the head of OSC, the Special Counsel has broad investigative power and administrative \nauthority.3  In sum, whether an inferior or principal officer, the Special Counsel is removable at will. \nB.  Plaintiff\u2019s Remaining Arguments Lack Merit. \nPlaintiff otherwise essentially reiterates the arguments he previously made in his reply brief in \nsupport of his motion for a preliminary injunction.  See Pl.\u2019s Reply in Supp. of his Mot. for Prelim. Inj. \nat 4-6, ECF No. 21.  Defendants have already responded to each of those arguments in their motion \nfor summary judgment.  Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 14-15.  Accordingly, Defendants rest on their prior arguments. \nII.  Plaintiff Is Not Entitled to An Injunction.  \nA.  Plaintiff Cannot Show Entitlement to Reinstatement.  \nThe Supreme Court recognized long ago that a court \u201chas no jurisdiction . . . to enjoin the \nPresident in the performance of his official duties.\u201d  Mississippi v. Johnson, 4 Wall. 475, 501 (1867).  \nAwarding an injunction that would reinstate Plaintiff to the office from which the President has \nremoved him inevitably restrains the President from exercising two core Article II powers:  it prevents \nhim from removing an officer that only he has the power to remove and it prevents him from \nappointing an officer that only he has the power to appoint.  Such an injunction would be an affront \n \n3 Indeed, Plaintiff continues to exercise this executive authority even after the Court granted his TRO \nrequest and reinstated him as Special Counsel.  See U.S. Office of Special Counsel v. Office of Personnel \nManagement,  (Feb.  21,  2025),  available  at \nhttps://osc.gov/Documents/PPP/Formal%20Stays/Stay%20Request%20(VA)%20Redacted.pdf. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 25     Filed 02/25/25     Page 7 of 13\nto the separation of powers.  Moreover, courts only have the authority to issue equitable relief \nrecognized at the Founding, and courts did not recognize the reinstatement of a principal officer as a \npermissible equitable remedy.  Accordingly, officers challenging their removal have \u201cgenerally sought \nremedies like backpay, not injunctive relief like reinstatement.\u201d  Order at 4, Dellinger, No. 24A790 \n(Gorsuch, J., dissenting); see also Def.\u2019s Mot. at 16-17.  Resisting these well-established conclusions, \nPlaintiff advances several arguments to try to avoid the constitutional bar on enjoining presidential \npowers that sit at the heart of his authority under Article II.  None has merit. \nFirst, the two cases Plaintiff cites for the proposition that a district court \u201chas authority to \ngrant declaratory and injunctive relief in this context\u201d do not hold this.  See Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 18 (citing \nSeverino v. Biden, 71 F.4th 1038, 1042-43 (D.C. Cir. 2023); Swan v. Clinton, 100 F.3d 973, 979-80 (D.C. \nCir. 1996)).  To the contrary, \u201c[a]n injunction preventing the President from firing an agency head\u2014\nand thus controlling how he performs his official duties\u2014is virtually unheard of.\u201d  Dellinger, 2025 WL \n559669, at *14 (Katsas, J., dissenting); see also Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 827 (1992)  (Scalia, \nJ., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (\u201cI am aware of only one instance in which we \nwere specifically asked to issue an injunction requiring the President to take specified executive acts \n[and] we emphatically disclaimed the authority to do so\u201d).  Neither Swan nor Severino ordered the \nreinstatement of a principal officer.  If anything, Severino and Swan only confirm the extent of the \nPresident\u2019s removal power under Article II: both cases upheld the President\u2019s power to remove \nofficers at will.  See Severino, 71 F.4th at 1043 (member of the Administrative Conference of the United \nStates); Swan, 100 F.3d at 983-88 (member of the Board of the National Credit Union Administration).   \nPlaintiff presumably cites Swan and Severino to support his argument that the court can enjoin \n\u201csubordinate executive officials\u201d in order to avoid the constitutional bar on enjoining the President, \nPl.\u2019s Mot. at 18-19, but this argument likewise fails.  Both cases held only that, for purposes of showing \nArticle III standing, the plaintiff would satisfy the redressability prong if he sought \u201cpartial relief\u201d \nfrom subordinate officials.  See Swan, 100 F.3d at 980-81.  In Severino, the court explained that \n\u201cenjoining the President to make a formal appointment would be a constitutionally exceptional step,\u201d \nbut observed that it \u201cneed not confront that difficult question because [its] jurisdiction does not \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 25     Filed 02/25/25     Page 8 of 13\ndepend on deciding whether an injunction ordering a presidential appointment would be available or \nappropriate.\u201d  71 F.4th at 1042.  The court explained that the \u201credressability prong of standing requires \nonly that we be able to offer [the plaintiff] \u2018at least some of the relief\u2019 he seeks, and it is \u201csufficient for \nArticle III standing if we can enjoin \u2018subordinate executive officials.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 1042-43 (emphasis added).  \nLikewise, in Swan, the court explained that \u201cthe partial relief Swan can obtain against subordinate \nexecutive officials is sufficient for redressability even recognizing that the President has the power, if \nhe so chose, to undercut this relief.\u201d  100 F.3d at 980-81.  The court emphasized that it was \u201csimply \nrecognizing that such partial relief is sufficient for standing purposes,\u201d and expressly declined to decide \nthe question of \u201cwhether we can order more complete relief.\u201d  Id. at 981.  As these courts aptly \nrecognized, the question of whether Plaintiff has standing to bring his removal claims is separate and \ndistinct from the question of whether a court can issue an injunction reinstating a principal officer to \nhis former post.  A court cannot do so.  See Def.\u2019s Mot. at 16-19. \nSecond, Plaintiff argues that the merger of law and equity somehow undermines the proposition \nthat the Court has no authority to issue equitable remedies not recognized at the Founding.  See Pl.\u2019s \nMot. at 23.  But that is beside the point.  As explained, see Def.\u2019s Mot. at 17-18, the Supreme Court \nrecently held that federal courts derive their equitable powers from the Judiciary Act of 1789, ch. 20, \n1 Stat. 73.  See Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo S.A. v. Alliance Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U.S. 308, 318 (1999).  \nThey must exercise those powers in accordance with \u201ctraditional principles of equity jurisdiction,\u201d as \nunderstood at the Founding.  Id. at 319 (citation omitted).  Federal courts may award only those \nequitable remedies that were \u201ctraditionally accorded by courts of equity\u201d; courts lack \u201cthe power to \ncreate remedies previously unknown to equity jurisprudence.\u201d  Id. at 319, 332.  And one of the most \nwell-established principles of equity jurisprudence is that a court may not enjoin the removal of an \nexecutive officer.  For instance, in White v. Berry, 171 U.S. 366 (1898), the Supreme Court reversed an \ninjunction preventing the removal of a federal revenue officer who had been appointed by the \nSecretary of the Treasury.  The Court explained that \u201ca court of equity will not, by injunction, restrain \nan executive officer from making a wrongful removal of a subordinate appointee, nor restrain the \nappointment of another.\u201d  Id. at 377 (citation omitted).  Similarly, in In re Sawyer, 124 U.S. 200 (1888), \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 25     Filed 02/25/25     Page 9 of 13\nthe Court held that a federal court lacked the power to enjoin the removal of a municipal officer.  It \nis \u201cwell settled,\u201d the Court explained, \u201cthat a court of equity has no jurisdiction over the appointment \nand removal of public officers.\u201d  Id. at 212.  The Court has reaffirmed those principles in several other \ncases.  See Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 231 (1962); Walton v. House of Representatives, 265 U.S. 487, 490 \n(1924); Harkrader v. Wadley, 172 U.S. 148, 165 (1898).   \nThat principle is longstanding, well established, and dispositive.  \u201cNo English case has been \nfound of a bill for an injunction restrain [an] appointment or removal.\u201d  Sawyer, 124 U.S. at 212.  State \ncourts have \u201cdenied\u201d the \u201cpower of a court of equity to restrain . . . removal\u201d in \u201cmany well considered \ncases.\u201d  Id.  And one 19th-century scholar wrote that \u201c[n]o principle of the law of injunctions, and \nperhaps no doctrine of equity jurisprudence, is more definitely fixed or more clearly established than \nthat  courts  of  equity  will  not  interfere  by  injunction  to  determine  questions  concerning  the \nappointment of public officers or their title to office.\u201d  2 James L. High, Treatise on the Law of Injunctions \n\u00a7 1312 (2d ed. 1880). \nPlaintiff also argues that the equitable remedy he seeks is not reinstatement, but what he \ndescribes as \u201ca continuance remedy.\u201d  Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 20.  Plaintiff fails to explain how a \u201ccontinuance \nremedy\u201d is one that, \u201cat the time of the Nation\u2019s founding,\u201d was \u201ctraditionally accorded by courts of \nequity.\u201d  Order at 4, Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 24A790 (U.S. Feb. 21, 2025) (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) \n(citing Grupo Mexicano, 527 U.S. at 3189)).  Whatever a \u201ccontinuance remedy\u201d even means, the practical \neffects of such a remedy would be no different than ordering Plaintiff reinstated to his former position.  \nBecause the President did remove from office, any injunction would necessarily require reinstatement \nto that office.  Indeed, none of the cases cited by Plaintiff involving reinstatement of government \nemployees,  see Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 23, presents the same issue as the one here:  reinstatement of a \nPresidentially-appointed, Senate-confirmed head of an agency. \nThird, Plaintiff argues that the Court can award declaratory relief against the President, Pl.\u2019s \nMot. at 19-20, but the same principles that foreclose reinstatement likewise foreclose declaratory relief.  \nA court \u201ccannot issue a declaratory judgment against the President.\u201d  Franklin, 505 U.S. at 827 (Scalia, \nJ., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment).  And a declaratory-judgment suit is \u201cessentially \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 25     Filed 02/25/25     Page 10 of 13\nan equitable cause of action.\u201d  Samuels v. Mackell, 401 U.S. 66, 70 (1971) (citation omitted).  \u201c[T]he \nDeclaratory Judgment Act provides that after a declaratory judgment is issued the district court may \nenforce it by granting \u2018further necessary or proper relief,\u2019 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2202, and therefore a declaratory \njudgment . . . might serve as the basis for a subsequent injunction.\u201d  Id. at 72.  \u201c[E]ven if the declaratory \njudgment is not used as a basis for actually issuing an injunction, the declaratory relief alone has \nvirtually the same practical impact as a formal injunction would.\u201d  Id.  As a result, \u201cthe same equitable \nprinciples relevant to the propriety of an injunction must be taken into consideration by federal district \ncourts in determining whether to issue a declaratory judgment.\u201d  Id. at 73.  To be sure, there may be \n\u201cunusual circumstances\u201d where \u201ca declaratory judgment might be appropriate\u201d even though \u201can \ninjunction [would] be withheld.\u201d  Id.  But \u201cordinarily,\u201d \u201cwhere an injunction would be impermissible,\u201d \n\u201cdeclaratory relief should . . . be denied as well.\u201d  Id. at 73; see Macauley v. Waterman S.S. Corp., 327 U.S. \n540, 545 n.4 (1946) (\u201cThe same principles which justified dismissal of the cause insofar as it sought \ninjunction justified denial of the prayer for a declaratory judgment.\u201d); Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. \nv. Huffman, 319 U.S. 293, 300 (1943) (The Declaratory Judgment Act \u201conly provided a new form of \nprocedure for the adjudication of rights in conformity\u201d with \u201cestablished equitable principles.\u201d).   \n  Fourth, Plaintiff argues that he can be reinstated to his former position through a writ of \nmandamus or by proceeding in quo warranto.  Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 21-22.  Plaintiff has satisfied the \nrequirements for neither mandamus or quo warranto.  The writ of mandamus \u201cis intended to provide \na remedy for a plaintiff only if he has exhausted all other avenues of relief and only if the defendant \nowes him a clear nondiscretionary duty.\u201d  Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U.S. 602, 616 (1984).  Mandamus is \n\u201cinappropriate except where a public official has violated a \u2018ministerial\u2019 duty.\u201d  Consolidated Edison Co. \nv. Ashcroft, 286 F.3d 600, 606 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  Plaintiff has not established that the President owes \nhim a \u201cclear nondiscretionary duty\u201d and the President\u2019s selection of who should lead an executive \nbranch agency is certainly not a mere ministerial task.  Further, many of the cases cited by Plaintiff do \nnot concern federal offices, and thus do not raise separation-of-powers concerns implicated here.  See, \ne.g., Crawford v. Addison, 73 U.S. 291, 297 (1867); Boyd v. Nebraska, 143 U.S. 135, 151 (1892).  As to \nPlaintiff\u2019s belated request for a writ of quo warranto, as Defendants previously stated, see Def.\u2019s Mot. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 25     Filed 02/25/25     Page 11 of 13\nat 18, Plaintiff has not even attempted to meet the prerequisites for a quo warranto application.4  See \nOrder at 4-5, Dellinger, No. 24A790 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (quo warranto is \u201ca distinct legal remedy \n[Plaintiff] never sought, the district court never invoked, and the procedures for which he did not \nfollow.\u201d).  The cases cited by Defendants holding that that a plaintiff challenging his removal could \nrequest these remedies does not mean that Plaintiff here has satisfied the requirements showing he is \nentitled to them\u2014and he has not made this showing.  Moreover, Plaintiff\u2019s acknowledgement that he \nmay pursue these legal remedies further underscores Defendants\u2019 point that the equitable remedy of \nreinstatement is not available to him. \n  Fifth,  Plaintiff  appears  to  request  that  the  Court  \u201ccraft  equitable  remedies\u201d  previously \nunrecognized.  Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 25-26.  As explained, the Supreme Court has expressly held that courts \n\u201clack the power to remedies previously unknown to equity jurisprudence.\u201d  Grupo, 527 U.S. 308 at \n332.  The Court should not contravene this binding precedent, and such a novel remedy would be \nparticularly disruptive here.  As the Supreme Court stated in White, allowing courts of equity to \nintervene in removal cases would thus \u201cinvade the domain . . . of the executive\u201d and \u201clead to the \nutmost confusion in the management of executive affairs.\u201d  171 U.S. at 76, 378. \n  Sixth, Plaintiff requests in the alternative that the Court issue partial summary judgment, \naccompanied by either a declaratory judgment that Plaintiff \u201cis the proper head of the OSC\u201d or \nbackpay.  Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 26-27.  For the reasons previously stated, a court cannot award declaratory \njudgment that effectively reinstates Plaintiff by announcing that he is the \u201cproper\u201d head of OSC.  And \neven if Plaintiff could eventually seek backpay, because Defendants have established here that Plaintiff \nwas lawfully removed, Def.\u2019s Mot. at 6-15, the Court should not award partial summary judgment in \nPlaintiff\u2019s favor.   \n \n4 Plaintiff concedes that he has not requested nor satisfied the requirements for a writ of quo warranto, \nbut argues that the Court should construe his request for relief as encompassing it.  Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 23-\n24 n.9.  Plaintiff, however, has plainly not satisfied the procedural requirements for the writ.  See D.C. \nCode \u00a7 16-3501.  Nor do any of his cited cases excuse noncompliance, including a prior request to the \nAttorney General. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 25     Filed 02/25/25     Page 12 of 13\nB.  Plaintiff Has Not Met the Other Injunction Factors.  \nAn injunction would plainly inflict concrete harm on the President.  The Special Counsel is \nnot merely an officer; he is the head of an executive department.  The statute empowers him to appoint \nsubordinates in his department, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1212(d)(1), and the Appointments Clause requires that \nhe be able to supervise inferior officers below him, see Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 13.  If the President loses \ncontrol of the Special Counsel, he loses control of the Office.  It should be self-evident that depriving \nthe President of control over an entire executive department in the earliest days of his administration \ninflicts serious and irreparable harm \nAn injunction would also harm the government by threatening to cause the mass invalidation \nof everything that the Special Counsel does after he is reinstated. See Def.\u2019s Mot. at 22-23.  Plaintiff \ndenies that the order would lead to such a result, Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 29, but his argument conflicts with two \nclear rules set forth in Collins: (1) \u201cthe Constitution prohibits even \u2018modest restrictions\u2019 on the \nPresident\u2019s power to remove the head of an agency with a single top officer,\u201d and (2) if \u201cthe President \nhad attempted to remove a Director but was prevented from doing so by a lower court decision,\u201d the \ntenure restriction would \u201cinflict compensable harm.\u201d  594 U.S. at 256, 259 (citation omitted). \nOn the other side of the ledger, Plaintiff fails to identify any irreparable harm to himself. Even \nif someone who is terminated suffers an \u201cinjury,\u201d the crucial point is that the injury is not irreparable.  \nA court can generally repair an injury to an individual from loss of employment by awarding post-\njudgment relief such as back pay, where appropriate.  But a court cannot repair the injury to the \nseparation of powers, the President, and our democratic system from a judicial order that deprives the \nPresident of control of an executive department for weeks or longer.  \nCONCLUSION \n  For the reasons above, the Court should grant summary judgment in favor of Defendants and \ndeny Plaintiff\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment. \n \n \nDated: February 25, 2025        Respectfully submitted, \n               \n              ERIC J.

President Trump nevertheless purported to remove \nhim without cause. In defense of that position, the government\u2014on behalf of the President and the \nother named Defendants\u2014claims that \u00a7 1211(b) is unconstitutional. The government also contends \nthat the Court lacks any power to preserve Special Counsel Dellinger in office, even if the \nPresident\u2019s purported termination was unlawful. The government is mistaken on both points. \nBecause those are purely legal questions and there are no disputes of material fact, the Court should \ngrant summary judgment to Special Counsel Dellinger and enter an order providing proper \ndeclaratory and injunctive relief.  \nBACKGROUND \nA.  The United States Office of Special Counsel \n1.  The Founding and Mission of the OSC \nThe Office of Special Counsel (\u201cOSC\u201d) is an independent federal agency, originally \nestablished by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (\u201cCSRA\u201d). See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(a). The \nCSRA was enacted to address widespread public concerns about the federal civil service\u2014\nincluding  evidence  that  it  was  vulnerable  to  political  manipulation  and  failed  to  protect \nwhistleblowers. See Developments in the Law\u2014Public Employment, 97 Harv. L. Rev. 1619, 1631-\n32 (1984). The CSRA began with President Carter, who recommended creating a Special Counsel, \n\u201cappointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate\u201d to investigate abuses of civil service \nlaws, and the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d), a nonpartisan board removable only for \ncause to adjudicate those disputes. See Federal Civil Service Reform Message to the Congress \n(Mar. 2, 1978). This structure, President Carter wrote, would \u201cguarantee independent and impartial \n1 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/24/25     Page 12 of 40\nprotection to employees\u201d and thereby \u201csafeguard the rights of Federal employees who \u2018blow the \nwhistle\u2019 on violations of laws or regulations by other employees, including their supervisors.\u201d Id. \nCongress accepted President Carter\u2019s proposal, including the MSPB and the Special \nCounsel with for-cause removal protections. See S. 2640, 95th Cong. (Mar. 3, 1978); H.R. Rep. \nNo. 95-1403, at 388 (1978) (supp. views of Rep. S. Solarz). Congress made an express finding that \n\u201cthe authority and power of the Special Counsel\u201d was required to \u201cinvestigate allegations involving \nprohibited personnel practices and reprisals against Federal employees.\u201d Civil Service Reform Act \nof 1978, \u00a7 3(4), Pub. L. No. 95-454, \u00a7 3(4), 92 Stat. 1111, 1112. Consistent with this vision, \nCongress  provided  that  the  Special  Counsel  could  be  removed  \u201cby  the  President  only  for \ninefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, \u00a7 1204. \nThis provision drew an initial objection from the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Legal \nCounsel (\u201cOLC\u201d), which President Carter effectively overruled when he subsequently signed the \nlaw and declared it would create \u201ca new system of excellence and accountability.\u201d Compare \nMemorandum Opinion for the General Counsel, Civil Service Commission, 2 Op. O.L.C. 120 \n(1978), with Jimmy Carter, Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 Statement on Signing S. 2640 Into \nLaw (Oct. 13, 1978).1 \nIn 1988, Congress again grew concerned that federal whistleblowers were not adequately \nprotected, and crafted the Whistleblower Protection Act to \u201cstrengthen and improve protection for \nthe rights of Federal employees, to prevent reprisals, and to help eliminate wrongdoing within the \nGovernment.\u201d Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-12, \u00a7 2(b), 103 Stat. 16, 16. \n \n1 The OLC opinion referenced here was requested not by President Carter but instead by the Civil \nService Commission, which would be replaced in the proposed CSRA. 2 Op. O.L.C. at 120. \n2 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/24/25     Page 13 of 40\nAs originally drafted, the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1988 separated the OSC from \nthe MSPB, establishing the OSC as an independent agency. The original draft also vested the OSC \nwith new powers. President Reagan, however, pocket vetoed this legislation, objecting to several \nnew authorities that the legislation would vest in the OSC\u2014singling out the authority to seek \njudicial review of adverse MSPB decisions in federal court, which would \u201cpermit[] the Executive \nbranch  to  litigate  against  itself.\u201d  Ronald  Reagan,  Memorandum  of  Disapproval  on  a  Bill \nConcerning Whistleblower Protection (Oct. 26, 1988). President Reagan also suggested hesitancy \nabout the bill\u2019s for-cause removal protections, which were identical to those already in effect. Id. \nAfter the pocket veto, Congress worked with Presidents Reagan and Bush to address their \nseparation-of-powers  concerns.  After  these  negotiations,  the  revised  bill\u2014the  enacted \nWhistleblower Protection Act of 1989\u2014no longer authorized the OSC to pursue litigation against \nother agencies in federal court. See 135 Cong. Rec. 5012, 5037 (Mar. 21, 1989) (statement of Rep. \nP. Schroeder) (\u201c[W]e agreed to make the changes requested by the administration to clip the special \ncounsel\u2019s wings.\u201d); id. at 5039 (statement of Rep. S. Parris) (\u201cAs amended, S. 20 would resolve \nthe administration\u2019s constitutional concerns by eliminating the right of the special counsel to sue \nin Federal court.\u201d).  \nBut those negotiations did not displace the OSC\u2019s status as an independent agency or its \nexisting for-cause removal provision. As the House Subcommittee on Civil Service stated, federal \nemployees required \u201cassurance that the Office of Special Counsel is a safe haven,\u201d because \notherwise it \u201ccan never be effective in protecting victims of prohibited personnel practices.\u201d Id. at \n5034  (Joint  Explanatory  Statement);  id.  at  5032  (statement  of  Rep.  G.  Sikorski)  (\u201cUntil \nwhistleblowers are confident that the Office of Special Counsel is on their side, that office will not \nbe  an  effective  advocate  for  their  cause.\u201d).  Following  this  inter-branch  agreement  on  the \n3 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/24/25     Page 14 of 40\nimportance of maintaining a measure of independence for the OSC, President Bush\u2019s Attorney \nGeneral thanked the bill\u2019s sponsor for \u201cforg[ing] a mutually acceptable resolution of our serious \nconstitutional concerns\u201d and \u201cpledge[d]\u201d to lobby for the Act as drafted. See Letter from Office of \nthe Attorney General to Sen. Levin dated Mar. 3, 1989, 135 Cong. Rec. 5012, 5033-34. \nUltimately, President Bush agreed that the revisions had \u201caddressed\u201d the \u201cconstitutional \nconcerns\u201d he and President Reagan had raised about the Act. George H.W. Bush, Remarks on \nSigning the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 (Apr. 10, 1989). Indeed, he specifically praised \nthat the Act would \u201cenhance the authority of the Office of Special Counsel to protect whistle-\nblowers,\u201d and that it \u201cretain[ed] current law which provides that the Special Counsel may only be \nremoved for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance.\u201d Id. Rather than reserve the question or \ncall this provision into doubt, President Bush thus made apparent his approval of the for-cause \nremoval limitation, which reflected a deliberate interbranch settlement of constitutional issues. \n2.  The OSC\u2019s Limited Jurisdiction and Functions \nAs contemplated by Congress and two Presidents in the enactments described above, the \nOSC maintains a unique and partly independent position to protect federal employees from \nprohibited personnel practices (\u201cPPPs\u201d)\u2014especially reprisal for whistleblowing. The OSC also \naffords a secure channel for employees to blow the whistle on wrongdoing. And it assists \nCongress\u2019s legislative and oversight agendas. \nNone of the OSC\u2019s authorities empowers it to regulate or penalize private activity. Instead, \nas an \u201combudsman\u201d and \u201cwatchdog,\u201d Frazier v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., 672 F.2d 150, 162-63 (D.C. \nCir. 1982), the OSC has \u201conly limited jurisdiction to enforce certain rules governing Federal \nGovernment employers and employees,\u201d Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau, 591 U.S. \n197, 221 (2020). And even as to federal employees, the OSC does not impose any discipline or \n4 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/24/25     Page 15 of 40\nother adverse action. Instead, the OSC receives allegations of PPPs and Hatch Act violations, \nassesses and investigates such complaints, and promotes a proper course of action. See 5 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 1212(a), 1216(c). Where the OSC finds that an allegation was warranted, it first works with the \nrelevant agency head to encourage voluntary corrective action and relief for the PPP victim (or \nvoluntary discipline from an agency head in the case of a Hatch Act violation). However, any \nrecommended action by the OSC may be rejected: the Special Counsel has no power to bind any \nother agency. Absent voluntary settlement, the OSC may petition the MSPB on the injured \nemployee\u2019s behalf. Id. \u00a7 1214. But an injured employee may also petition the MSPB directly \n(subject to certain procedural requirements). Id. \u00a7 1221.  \nIn addition, the OSC can refer a complaint to the MSPB, asking that a perpetrator of a PPP \nor Hatch Act violation be disciplined. See id. \u00a7\u00a7 1215, 1216. In such circumstances, the OSC \nexercises no authority over the MSPB, which is an independent adjudicatory agency whose \nmembers separately enjoy for-cause removal protections. Id. \u00a7 1202(d). \u201c[T]he MSPB is free to \ndisagree with the Special Counsel and often does.\u201d Am. Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Emps., AFL-CIO v. \nO\u2019Connor (\u201cAFGE\u201d), 747 F.2d 748, 753 (D.C. Cir. 1984). In that respect, the MSPB supervises \nthe OSC\u2019s exercise of authority to refer complaints and makes its own decisions. Similarly, while \nthe OSC has limited authority to issue subpoenas, only the MSPB can seek to enforce such \nsubpoenas. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1212(b)(3)(A). Thus, as the D.C. Circuit has explained, \u201cthe Special \nCounsel\u2019s \u2018seemingly broad powers are greatly circumscribed in practice, [in part] by the Special \nCounsel\u2019s lack of authority to require either the Board or other agencies to do its bidding.\u2019\u201d AFGE, \n747 F.2d at 753 (quoting 97 Harv. L. Rev. at 1643). Even when the MSPB\u2014not the OSC\u2014chooses \nto impose discipline, the maximum \u201ccivil penalty\u201d it can issue is $1,330. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1216(a)(3); 5 \nCFR \u00a7 1201.126(a). And any decision by the MSPB is subject to judicial review in federal court. \n5 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/24/25     Page 16 of 40\n5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1214(c)(2), 1215(a)(4), 7703(b). The OSC cannot participate in any litigation in any \nArticle III court, except in a limited role as amicus curiae. See id. \u00a7 1212(h). \nBeyond  its  human-resources  investigative  role,  the  Whistleblower  Protection  Act \nauthorizes the OSC to receive reports from employee-whistleblowers within agencies. See id. \n\u00a7 1213(a). However, if a report appears credible, the OSC cannot conduct its own investigation or \notherwise take direct action on the report. Instead, it may only review the investigation conducted \nby the whistleblower\u2019s agency, and then report the investigation and the OSC\u2019s own assessment \nof it to Congress and the President. See id. \u00a7\u00a7 1212(a)(3), 1213(c)-(e). The Special Counsel must \nkeep the identity of any whistleblower strictly confidential. Id. \u00a7 1213(h).2 \nThe OSC is also vested with limited authority to \u201cprescribe . . . regulations,\u201d although this \nauthority is strictly and statutorily limited only to internal matters \u201cnecessary to perform the \nfunctions of the Special Counsel.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1212(e). The Special Counsel may separately issue \nnonbinding advisory opinions concerning the Hatch Act, but he has no rulemaking authority that \ncompels compliance. Id. \u00a7 1212(f); see also, e.g., AFGE, 747 F.2d at 752 (\u201c[T]he advice the \nSpecial Counsel is permitted to give creates no law and binds neither the public nor any agency or \nofficer of government.\u201d); Authority for Issuing Hatch Act Regulations, 18 Op. O.L.C. 1, 1 (1994). \nFinally, virtually every action undertaken by the OSC\u2014from receipt of allegations, to \ninvestigations, to agreed corrective actions, to complaints in the MSPB\u2014must be directly reported \nto Congress to inform oversight and legislative functions in this space. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1217, 1218. \n \n2 In a similarly advisory capacity, the OSC reviews regulations issued by the Office of Personnel \nManagement for any rule that would require committing a PPP. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1212(a)(4). \n6 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/24/25     Page 17 of 40\nB.  Procedural History \nPlaintiff Hampton Dellinger has served as Special Counsel since March 6, 2024, following \nhis nomination by the President and confirmation by the Senate to a five-year term. On Friday, \nFebruary 7, 2025, at 7:22 PM, Special Counsel Dellinger received an email from Sergio Gor, \nAssistant to the President and Director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, that \nstated: \u201cOn behalf of President Donald J.

That afternoon, this Court held an in-person hearing. The Court proposed that \nthe government \u201cextend the effective date of the President\u2019s proposed action while [the parties] \nbrief [the motion],\u201d but the government refused that proposal.

The government then requested leave to file an \nopposition the next day to Special Counsel Dellinger\u2019s TRO application. Id. 27:23-24. The Court \nagreed, noting that it may issue an administrative stay to preserve the status quo ante while it \ndecided  the  TRO  application.  Id.  25:8-11.  That  evening,  the  Court  issued  a  three-day \nadministrative stay, ordering that Special Counsel Dellinger be allowed to continue to serve in his \nposition through midnight on February 13, 2025. See Order, No. 25 Civ. 385 (D.D.C. Feb. 10, \n2025, 8:20 PM). \nThe next morning, the government filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C.

One day later, Special Counsel Dellinger filed a \n7 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/24/25     Page 18 of 40\nresponse. Opp. to Emergency Mot. for a Stay, No. 25-5025 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 12, 2025), ECF 7. That \nevening,  the  D.C.  Circuit  denied  the  government\u2019s  motion  and  sua  sponte  dismissed  the \ngovernment\u2019s appeal, holding that the court lacked appellate jurisdiction and that the government \nwas not entitled to mandamus relief. Order at 1-2, No. 25-5025 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 12, 2015), ECF 9 \n(Katsas, Childs, Pan, JJ.). Judge Katsas issued a concurring opinion. See id. at 3. \nLater that night, the Court granted Special Counsel Dellinger\u2019s TRO application. Dellinger \nv. Bessent, No. 25 Civ. 385, 2025 WL 471022, at *2 (D.D.C. Feb 12, 2025). Consistent with \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 65, the Court limited its TRO to a fourteen-day period and \nscheduled a hearing on February 26 to decide whether to issue \u201can appealable preliminary \ninjunction.\u201d Id. at *14. The government responded to that order by filing a notice of appeal and a \nsecond emergency stay application in the D.C. Circuit. The government also filed a second stay \napplication before Your Honor, Mot. to Stay TRO Pending Appeal, No. 25 Civ. 385 (D.D.C. Feb. \n12, 2025), ECF 16, which the Court denied the next day, Order, No. 25 Civ. 385 (D.D.C. Feb. 13, \n2025), ECF 19. On Saturday, February 15, the Court issued a scheduling order consolidating \nconsideration of a preliminary injunction with consideration of the merits. Order, No. 25 Civ. 385 \n(D.D.C. Feb. 15, 2025, 4:27 PM).  \nThat evening, the D.C. Circuit denied the government\u2019s second motion for an emergency \nstay and dismissed its appeal, again finding that the government had failed to demonstrate appellate \njurisdiction or the propriety of mandamus relief. Order, No. 25-5028 (D.C. Cir. Feb 15, 2025), \nECF 9. Judge Katsas dissented. See id. at 16-27. The following morning, the government filed an \nemergency application asking the Supreme Court to vacate the TRO and enter an administrative \nstay. Application to Vacate, Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 24A790 (U.S. Feb. 16, 2025). Two days \nlater, Special Counsel Dellinger opposed that request. Opposition Brief, Dellinger v. Bessent, No. \n8 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/24/25     Page 19 of 40\n24A790 (U.S. Feb. 18, 2025). On February 21, 2025, the Supreme Court issued an order holding \nthe stay application in abeyance until February 26, 2025, the day the TRO is currently scheduled \nto expire. Order, Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 24A790 (U.S. Feb. 21, 2025). Justices Sotomayor and \nJackson voted to deny the government\u2019s emergency application. Id. at 2. Justice Gorsuch, joined \nby Justice Alito, filed a dissenting opinion. Id. at 2 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting). \nMeanwhile, the parties proceeded with briefing in this Court. On February 20, Special \nCounsel Dellinger filed a reply in support of his motion for a preliminary injunction. See No. 25 \nCiv. 385 (D.D.C. Feb. 20, 2025), ECF 21. That motion remains pending. On February 21, the \ngovernment moved for summary judgment. See No. 25 Civ. 385 (D.D.C. Feb. 20, 2025), ECF 22. \nThis brief constitutes a response to that filing and a cross-motion for summary judgment.   \nLEGAL STANDARD \nA court \u201cshall grant summary judgment if the movant shows that there is no genuine \ndispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 56(a). A movant entitled to summary judgment may also obtain a permanent injunction by \ndemonstrating: \u201c(1) that [he] has suffered an irreparable injury; (2) that remedies available at law, \nsuch as monetary damages, are inadequate to compensate for that injury; (3) that, considering the \nbalance of hardships between the plaintiff and defendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) \nthat the public interest would not be disserved by a permanent injunction.\u201d Anatol Zukerman & \nCharles Krause Reporting, LLC v. U.S. Postal Serv., 64 F.4th 1354, 1364 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (quoting \neBay Inc. v. MercExchange, L.L.C., 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006)). Factors (3) and (4) merge when \nthe defendant is the government. Id.

Special Counsel Dellinger\u2019s Removal Was Unlawful \nThere is a single reason why Special Counsel Dellinger\u2019s motion for summary judgment \nshould be granted and the government\u2019s motion should be denied: the government did not comply \nwith an applicable and constitutional for-cause removal protection statute when it purported to \nterminate the Special Counsel. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b). There are no disputes of material fact that \nwould preclude the Court from deciding whether Special Counsel Dellinger\u2019s purported removal \nwas  unlawful.  Indeed,  the  government  has  conceded  that  Special  Counsel  Dellinger\u2019s \ntermination\u2014which did not reference any finding of \u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance \nin office\u201d\u2014violated \u00a7 1211(b). The government\u2019s position depends entirely on the premise that \u00a7 \n1211(b) violates the separation of powers under Seila Law, 591 U.S. 197, and Collins v. Yellen, \n594 U.S. 220 (2021). The Court can address that claim as a matter of law. In so doing, it should \nreject the government\u2019s position\u2014as it already did at the TRO stage. See Dellinger, 2025 WL \n471022, at *5 (\u201cThe Supreme Court has taken pains to carve the OSC out of its pronouncements \nconcerning the President\u2019s broad authority to remove officials who assist him in discharging his \nduties at will.\u201d); see also Order at 14, No. 25-5028 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 15, 2025), ECF 9 (\u201c[T]he cited \ncases do not hold that the President has unrestricted power to remove the Special Counsel.\u201d).  \nAs we will show, taken together, Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 \n(1935), Seila Law, and Collins all support the constitutionality of the OSC\u2019s for-cause removal \nlimitation. That is true for two independent reasons: (a) the Special Counsel is an inferior rather \nthan principal officer (and those cases all concerned principal officers); and (b) the central grounds \ngiven for invalidating for-cause removal restrictions in Seila Law and Collins do not apply here.  \n10 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/24/25     Page 21 of 40\nA.  Special Counsel Dellinger Is an Inferior Officer \nFor inferior officers, Congress can \u201climit and restrict the power of removal as it deems best \nfor the public interest.\u201d United States v. Perkins, 116 U.S. 483, 485 (1886); see also Myers v. \nUnited States, 272 U.S. 52, 161-64 (1926); Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 689 n.27 (1988). The \nSupreme Court recognized that important distinction concerning inferior officers in Seila Law. See \n591 U.S. at 218-20. In assessing whether a given official is an inferior or principal officer, the key \nquestion is \u201cwhether he has a superior other than the President.\u201d United States v. Arthrex, Inc., 594 \nU.S. 1, 13 (2021) (cleaned up). Courts also consider the \u201cnature, scope, and duration of an officer\u2019s \nduties.\u201d Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 217 n.3 (citing Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, 661 (1997)). \nUnder that standard, the Special Counsel of the OSC is an inferior officer\u2014and Congress \nis thus freer to set terms for his removal from office. As explained above, the Special Counsel\u2019s \nrole is important but circumscribed. The OSC exercises what this Court has aptly described as \n\u201climited jurisdiction.\u201d Dellinger, 2025 WL 471022, at *8. In essence, he is an ombudsman. He \ncannot regulate or penalize (directly or indirectly) any private conduct. Within the world of federal \nemployment, moreover, he cannot impose any discipline or adverse action on his own authority. \nInstead, he receives complaints and encourages agencies to seek consensual resolutions; in some \ncases, he may also petition the MSPB on an injured employee\u2019s behalf or petition it to address a \npossible Hatch Act violation, but it is then up to the MSPB how it wishes to act on the petition. \nThe MSPB is \u201cfree to disagree with the Special Counsel and often does.\u201d AFGE, 747 F.2d at 753. \nThe Special Counsel can issue subpoenas while investigating, but he cannot actually enforce \nthem\u2014only the MSPB can do so. Similarly, although the Special Counsel can issue internal \nregulations and Hatch Act advisory opinions, they \u201cbind[] neither the public nor any agency or \nofficer of government.\u201d Id. at 752. The Special Counsel cannot bring an action in federal court. \n11 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/24/25     Page 22 of 40\nNor can he conduct his own investigation of reports from employee-whistleblowers within \nagencies; for such cases, he only reviews and assesses investigations by the relevant agency.  \nIn these concrete respects, the Special Counsel\u2019s powers do not resemble the authority of \nthe principal officers who lead the CFPB and FHFA. The CFPB Director, for instance, wields the \npower to \u201cunilaterally . . . issue final regulations, oversee adjudications, set enforcement priorities, \ninitiate prosecutions, and determine what penalties to impose on private parties.\u201d Seila Law, 591 \nU.S. at 225. The FHFA Director, in turn, can \u201chold hearings,\u201d \u201csuspend corporate officers,\u201d \u201cbring \ncivil actions in federal court,\u201d and \u201cimpose penalties ranging from $2,000 to $2 million per day.\u201d \nCollins, 594 U.S. at 230. The Special Counsel lacks these kinds of executive authorities. Nor does \nthe Special Counsel\u2019s HR-oriented administrative functions compare to the criminal enforcement \npower wielded by U.S. Attorneys. As the Court knows well, U.S. Attorneys possess direct civil \nand criminal enforcement authority and wield immense power to directly and indirectly affect the \nrights, property, and liberty of private parties; they can bind and make representations on behalf \nof the federal Executive Branch; and they seek enforcement of their investigative subpoenas not \nfrom another independent agency of the Executive Branch, but rather from the Judiciary. The \nSpecial Counsel (and the OSC more generally) lacks any of those core executive prerogatives\u2014\nand most certainly lacks the authority to act coercively against third parties on its own prerogative.  \nAccordingly, the Special Counsel is properly considered an inferior officer under Supreme \nCourt precedent\u2014and the for-cause removal provision is thus lawful. The government disagrees, \nstating that inferior officers must have superiors \u201cother than the President.\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. 14 (quoting \nArthrex, 594 U.S. at 13).3 But in practice, the Special Counsel does have such superiors and \n \n3 \u201cGov\u2019t Br. __\u201d refers to the government\u2019s memorandum of law in support of its motion for \nsummary judgment, ECF 22. \n12 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/24/25     Page 23 of 40\nsupervisors: he is effectively supervised by and accountable to the MSPB and the other federal \nagencies where whistleblowers raise concerns, since it is ultimately their decision whether and \nhow to accept his positions. Those agencies must exercise their independent discretion in assessing \nwhether to pursue the Special Counsel\u2019s recommendations and, in that sense, act as \u201cmanager[s] \nor overseer[s]\u201d of the OSC by deciding which actions by the OSC may proceed further. Supervisor, \nBlack\u2019s Law Dictionary (12th ed. 2024); Supervisor, Oxford English Dictionary (2d ed. 1989) (\u201can \noverseer; a person who directs or oversees a task\u201d). As a commonsense matter, government \nofficials with limited authority and whose decisions are reviewable or modifiable by someone else \ninside the Executive Branch are not constitutional principal officers. See Vanda Pharms. Inc. v. \nFood & Drug Admin., No. 23 Civ. 2812, 2024 WL 4133623, at *19 (D.D.C. Sept. 10, 2024) \n(\u201c[I]nferior officers may issue binding resolutions so long as they are properly supervised by a \nsuperior with the power to direct and overrule their decisions.\u201d); Villarreal-Dancy v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of \nthe Air Force, No. 19 Civ. 2985, 2021 WL 3144942, at *9 n.5 (D.D.C. July 26, 2021). The Special \nCounsel entirely lacks authority to issue binding decisions, and any recommendation he makes, \nwhether that be to the MSPB or another agency head, is subject to the discretion of principal \nofficers. This intra-branch supervision means that the Special Counsel is not a principal officer.  \nThe government next claims that even if the Special Counsel is an inferior officer, Congress \nstill may not restrict his removal. Gov\u2019t Br. 14. Citing Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926), \nthe government states that if an inferior officer is sufficiently important to require the Senate\u2019s \nparticipation in his appointment, then the President must be able to fire him at will.  \nBut Myers concerned Congress\u2019s attempt to vest the removal power in Congress itself\u2014\nnot the imposition of modest limits on the President\u2019s ability to remove an official. 272 U.S. at \n107-08; see Morrison, 487 U.S. at 687 n.24 (\u201c[T]he only issue actually decided in Myers was that \n13 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/24/25     Page 24 of 40\n\u2018the President had power to remove a postmaster of the first class, without the advice and consent \nof the Senate as required by act of Congress.\u2019\u201d (quoting Humphrey\u2019s Executor, 295 U.S. at 626)). \nThus, any \u201cgeneral language\u201d in Myers about Congress\u2019s ability to impose removal limitations \nshould be read \u201cas referring in context to circumstances similar to the circumstances then before \nthe  Court  and  not  referring  to  quite  different  circumstances  that  the  Court  was  not  then \nconsidering.\u201d Illinois v. Lidster, 540 U.S. 419, 424 (2004). Moreover, Myers itself also includes \ndicta inconsistent with the government\u2019s position. Specifically, Myers noted that, \u201c[t]o take away \nthis power of removal in relation to an inferior office created by statute, although that statute \nprovided for an appointment thereto by the President and confirmation by the Senate, would \nrequire very clear and explicit language. It should not be held to be taken away by mere inference \nor implication.\u201d Myers, 272 U.S. at 163 (quoting Shurtleff v. United States, 189 U.S. 311, 315 \n(1903)) (emphasis added). That is precisely the situation here: Congress used \u201cvery clear and \nexplicit language\u201d to create a for-cause removal protection. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b). And the \nSupreme Court has clarified that what matters in assessing the lawfulness of removal protections \nfor inferior officers is not the method of appointment, but whether the inferior officer \u201clack[s] \npolicymaking or significant administrative authority.\u201d Seila, 591 at 218 (quoting Morrison, 487 \nU.S. at 691)); Dellinger, 2025 WL 471022, at *6 (observing that \u201clike the independent counsel, \nplaintiff does not appear to have policymaking or significant administrative authority\u201d). The \nSpecial Counsel lacks any authority to make binding decisions. Therefore, under the law as set \nforth by the Supreme Court, the OSC\u2019s for-cause removal provision is valid.4   \n \n4 The government\u2019s view of these issues is not a model of consistency. Just days ago, the \ngovernment argued before Judge Chutkan that Elon Musk, the single-headed Administrator of the \nDepartment of Government Efficiency, is not a principal or inferior officer because he lacks \n\u201cformal authority to exercise the sovereign power of the United States\u201d and because his work \u201cis \na purely internal act of government\u201d in \u201ca preparatory step to inform some later action.\u201d Defs.\u2019 \n14 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/24/25     Page 25 of 40\nB.  The Statutory Removal Protection Comports with Supreme Court Precedents \nAlternatively, even if Special Counsel Dellinger is a principal officer, the government\u2019s \nargument that \u00a7 1211 is unconstitutional under Seila Law and Collins fails because the OSC is \ndistinguishable from the agencies at issue in those cases\u2014the CFPB and FHFA\u2014in ways that \npowerfully support the continued constitutionality of its removal limitation. \nFirst, Seila Law and Collins were animated by a profound concern about the President\u2019s \ninability to remove officials sitting atop single-headed agencies that exercise core executive power \nin ways that could \u201cdictate and enforce policy for a vital segment of the economy affecting millions \nof Americans.\u201d Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 225; accord Collins, 594 U.S. at 255. In that scenario, even \n\u201cmodest restrictions\u201d on the President\u2019s removal authority may impede his ability to carry out his \nArticle II duties. Collins, 594 U.S. at 256 (quoting Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 228 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted)); see Gov\u2019t Br. 15. But here, that concern is not implicated: the OSC is an \nombudsman with limited advisory and reporting functions focused mainly on HR issues. In \nperforming these functions, the OSC does not regulate or penalize private activity. See Seila Law, \n591 U.S. at 221 (noting that the OSC \u201cdoes not bind private parties at all\u201d). The OSC also lacks \nthe power to issue binding regulations, oversee adjudications, commence prosecutions, determine \nwhat penalties to impose, proceed in an Article III tribunal, or control in any way the substantive \nregulatory framework for any public or private entities. Further, the OSC\u2019s authority to promulgate \nregulations is confined to nonbinding advisory opinions and internal OSC affairs. See AFGE, 747 \nF.2d at 752 (observing that such regulations \u201cbind[] neither the public nor any agency or officer \n \nResp. to Pls.\u2019 Revised Proposed TRO at 3-4, New Mexico v. Musk, No. 25 Civ. 429 (D.D.C. Feb. \n13, 2025), ECF 20. As set forth above, the Special Counsel, too, is limited to purely internal acts \nof government that may subsequently inform some later action by other agencies.  \n15 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/24/25     Page 26 of 40\nof government\u201d). And only the MSPB, not the OSC, can issue decisions in administrative \nadjudications arising from the OSC\u2019s performance of its statutory duties.  \nThat is plainly not the type of \u201cregulatory and enforcement authority\u201d contemplated by the \nSupreme Court in Collins. 594 U.S. at 253; See Gov\u2019t Br. 15. Looking to the governing statutory \nframework\u2014rather than cherry-picked language from the OSC website\u2014the OSC\u2019s work occurs \nwithin a \u201climited jurisdiction\u201d related to federal employers and employees. Seila Law, 591 U.S. at \n221. As a matter of constitutional first principles, it poses no \u201cspecial threat to individual liberty\u201d \nfor the Special Counsel to receive limited independence from political control in reviewing and \npreliminarily investigating confidential whistleblower reports from federal employees. Id. at 223. \nSecond, consistent with the reasoning of Humphrey\u2019s Executor, the OSC exists to vindicate \nfunctions and interests held in common by Congress, the Executive Branch, and the public. \nCongress carefully designed the OSC to play an important reporting role with respect to legislative \noversight and deliberations. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1217. The OSC\u2019s work also furthers the distinct and \nshared inter-branch interest in promoting Executive Branch compliance with congressionally \nimposed  ethical  and  personnel  requirements  (although,  again,  not  through  issuing  binding \nregulations,  overseeing  adjudications,  or  commencing  prosecutions,  see  Gov\u2019t  Br.  15).  See \nDellinger, 2025 WL 471022, at *8 (\u201cThe agency\u2019s statutory functions require it to report directly \nto Congress about what it has found and whether any executive agency has stood in its way.\u201d).  In \nthat respect, the OSC is more than just an aspect of the executive power or extension of presidential \nwill. See Humphrey\u2019s Executor, 295 U.S. at 628. Moreover, the OSC\u2019s structure reflects a heavily \nnegotiated inter-branch resolution that was embraced by President Bush when he signed the \nWhistleblower Protection Act (and by his Attorney General in cooperating to pass the bill). In fact, \nnot  one,  but  two  Presidents\u2014Carter  and  Bush\u2014signed  legislation  with  for-cause  removal \n16 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/24/25     Page 27 of 40\nprotections at the OSC, making clear that any interstitial concerns raised by their subordinates at \nthe OLC had either been addressed or overruled in practice by the Office of the President.5 \nFinally, the need for independence at the OSC is unique in its character and purposes. With \nrespect to the CFPB and FHFA, the case for agency independence rested heavily on a substantive \nbelief that economic regulation should be free of specific forms of presidential political control. \nSee Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 207; Collins, 594 U.S. at 229-30. Agency independence in those settings \nwas designed to restrain the President\u2019s ability to direct the agencies\u2019 regulatory powers consistent \nwith his agenda. Unfettered removal discretion in those circumstances served \u201cvital purposes.\u201d \nCollins, 594 U.S. at 252; see Gov\u2019t Br. 15. Here, in contrast, the OSC lacks any regulatory \npowers\u2014and the independence afforded by its statutory for-cause removal provisions serves an \nentirely different function. Rather than hamper the President\u2019s substantive regulatory agenda, the \nOSC\u2019s independence protects and assures whistleblowers, including those who may be reluctant \nto disclose potential wrongdoing to those in their own agencies. If the official charged with \nprotecting  whistleblowers  from  retaliation  was  himself  utterly  vulnerable  to  retaliation  and \nremoval for taking on politically charged or inconvenient cases, then the OSC\u2019s whistleblower \nprotection purpose might fail when it is most needed. Simply put, Congress reasonably found\u2014\nand two Presidents agreed\u2014that the Special Counsel cannot serve as an independent watchdog, or \nprotect  whistleblowers,  if  he  is  subject  at  all  times  to  removal  without  cause.  See,  e.g., \nConstitutionality of the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s Tenure Protection, 2021 WL 2981542, \n \n5 The government suggests that OLC opinions are a more accurate reflection of the Executive \nBranch\u2019s views than the positions taken by two Presidents. Whatever the virtue of that claim in \ngeneral, it is exceptionally weak here given President Bush\u2019s decision to single out the for-cause \nremoval  provision  while  declaring  that  negotiators  had  resolved  outstanding  constitutional \ndisagreements between the Executive and Congress in the Whistleblower Protection Act.  \n17 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/24/25     Page 28 of 40\nat  *6  n.3,  *9  (O.L.C.  July  8,  2021)  (concluding  that  Collins  rendered  the  Social  Security \nCommissioner  removable  at-will  but  did  not  apply  to  the  OSC  by  virtue  of  its  \u201climited \njurisdiction\u201d). It is presumably for this very reason that \u201cSeila Law specifically distinguishes the \nOffice of Special Counsel in its analysis.\u201d Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5028, 2025 WL 559669, \nat *14 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 15, 2025); see Gov\u2019t Br. 15. \nAccordingly, the OSC\u2019s for-cause removal protection is constitutional.  \nII.  This Court Should Enter a Permanent Injunction \nNo genuine disputes of material fact prevent the Court from concluding that Special \nCounsel Dellinger satisfies the requirements for a permanent injunction. The government errs by \nclaiming that the Court has no authority to order the relief Special Counsel Dellinger seeks. \nMoreover, he has suffered irreparable harm from being denied his right to perform in office with \nthe removal protections given by Congress; monetary damages cannot compensate for that injury; \nand the balance of the equities and the public\u2019s interest also weigh firmly against the government.  \nA.  This Court Has Authority to Grant the Requested Relief  \nBefore even addressing the permanent-injunction factors, the government argues that this \nCourt lacks authority to grant the relief that Special Counsel Dellinger seeks. But a district court \nhas authority to grant declaratory and injunctive relief in this context\u2014including continuance and \nreinstatement remedies. See Severino v. Biden, 71 F.4th 1038, 1042-43 (D.C. Cir. 2023); Swan v. \nClinton, 100 F.3d 973, 979-80 (D.C. Cir. 1996). The government\u2019s contrary arguments fail. \nFirst, the government claims that Special Counsel Dellinger\u2019s requested relief would \nimpermissibly enjoin the President. Gov\u2019t Br. 19, 23. But Special Counsel Dellinger has sought a \ndeclaratory judgment, not injunctive relief, against the President. See Compl. at 13-14, No. 25 Civ. \n385 (D.D.C. Feb. 10, 2025), ECF 1. The D.C. Circuit has already recognized as much and noted \n18 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/24/25     Page 29 of 40\nthat a court \u201ccan unquestionably review the legality of the President\u2019s action by enjoining the \nofficers who would attempt to enforce the President\u2019s order.\u201d Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5028, \n2025 WL 559669, at *6 n.1 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 15, 2025); see also id. (concluding that \u201cthe TRO is \nproperly read as not applying directly to the President but rather to the other defendants acting on \nhis behalf\u201d). Under binding D.C. Circuit precedent, this Court may provide effective relief to \nSpecial Counsel Dellinger by enjoining the same \u201csubordinate executive officials\u201d who are \nresponsible for implementing the President\u2019s attempted termination. Severino, 71 F.4th at 1042-\n43; Swan, 100 F.3d at 980; Dellinger, 2025 WL 559669, at *6 n.1. And this Court can also grant \ndeclaratory relief. See, e.g., Knight First Amend. Inst. v. Trump, 302 F. Supp. 3d 541, 579-80 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2018), aff\u2019d, 928 F.3d 226 (2d Cir. 2019), vacated as moot, 141 S. Ct. 1220 (2021) \n(granting declaratory relief and noting that \u201call government officials are presumed to follow the \nlaw once the judiciary has said what the law is\u201d)  \nSecond, the government claims that courts generally lack the power in equity (or otherwise) \nto reinstate unlawfully removed officials. Gov\u2019t Br. 17-18. To the extent this argument is focused \non principal officers, it falls short because the Special Counsel is an inferior officer. See supra I.A. \nThe government\u2019s argument is also flawed in several additional respects.6 \nTo start, Special Counsel Dellinger does not seek (and this Court has not provided for) \n\u201creinstatement\u201d to  the  office of Special Counsel. Rather, his position is that his purported \ntermination without cause on February 7, 2025, was void ab initio. See Harris v. Bessent, No. 25 \n \n6 In suggesting otherwise\u2014in a dissent that was itself fairly tentative\u2014Justice Gorsuch had not \nreceived briefing on many of the authorities set forth here (since the government meaningfully \ndeveloped its arguments on this point for the first time only at the Supreme Court, which meant \nthat neither this Court nor the D.C. Circuit nor Special Counsel Dellinger had much opportunity \nbefore emergency filings at the Supreme Court to properly research and address the issue). \n19 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/24/25     Page 30 of 40\nCiv. 412, 2025 WL 521027, at *8 (D.D.C. Feb. 18, 2025) (\u201cDefendants thus conflate wrongful \ntermination with the lack of power to effectuate termination\u2014at least without cause.\u201d). Special \nCounsel Dellinger therefore seeks a declaration that his February 7 termination was unlawful and \nan order against subordinate executive officials to provide him the privileges and authorities of the \nSpecial Counsel, which would extend the relief this Court already provided in its TRO. See \nDellinger, 2025 WL 471022, at *14 (ordering that Mr. Dellinger \u201cshall continue to serve as the \nSpecial Counsel\u201d (emphasis added)); accord Paroczay v. Hodges, 219 F. Supp. 89, 94 (D.D.C \n1963) (ordering that plaintiff\u2019s involuntary resignation was \u201cvoid and of no effect; hence he was \nnever legally separated from his position\u201d); Mackie v. Bush, 809 F. Supp. 144, 147 (D.D.C. 1993) \n(granting a preliminary injunction against removal of members of Board of Governors of the Postal \nService Board), vacated as moot sub nom. Mackie v. Clinton, 10 F.3d 13 (D.C. Cir.).7 This is a \ncontinuance remedy, not a reinstatement.   \nAnd it is settled that such limited injunctive relief would properly and \u201cde facto\u201d grant \nSpecial Counsel Dellinger continued service in office. Severino, 71 F.4th at 1042-43; Swan, 100 \nF.3d at 979-80; id. at 989 (Silberman, J., concurring) (\u201c[W]e could grant appellant all the relief he \nwould ever need in this case . . . without ever attempting to impose judicial power directly on the \nPresident  of  the  United  States.\u201d);  Spicer  v.  Biden,  575  F.  Supp.  3d 93,  97  (D.D.C.  2021) \n(\u201cFollowing Swan, the Court could grant effective relief in this case by ordering [defendants], in \ntheir capacities as the Board\u2019s Chairman and Designated Federal Officer, to treat the plaintiffs as \nfull members of the Board.\u201d). An injunction would thus preserve rather than reinstate the Special \n \n7 While the fact pattern in Mackie presents a different theory of irreparable injury, Dellinger, 2025 \nWL 471022, at *11 n.6, the relief ordered by the court (specifically, that officers of an independent \nagency must be allowed to continue to serve in office) is directly relevant here. \n20 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/24/25     Page 31 of 40\nCounsel\u2019s  ongoing  tenure\u2014as  confirmed  by  D.C.  Circuit  authorities  inconsistent  with  the \ngovernment\u2019s position.8 \nMore broadly, the government errs in contending that courts are generally powerless to \nrestore unlawfully removed officers to their positions. Gov\u2019t Br. 17-19. Nothing precludes a court \nfrom ordering such relief. See Laurence H. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 706 n.20 (3d ed. \n2000) (explaining that \u201can injunction could issue to bar unlawful removal and . . . an appropriate \nsubordinate could be required by mandamus to reinstate an unlawfully removed officer\u201d). Courts \nin this Circuit have accordingly ordered reinstatement of officers (or prevented their unlawful \nremoval) across the Executive Branch. See Berry v. Reagan, No. 83-3182, 1983 WL 538, at *5 \n(D.D.C. Nov. 14, 1983) (granting preliminary injunction against removal of plaintiffs as members \nof the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights), vacated as moot, 732 F.2d 949 (D.C. Cir. 1983); Mackie, \n809 F. Supp. at 147-48; Salleh v. Christopher, 876 F. Supp. 297, 304, 307-08 (D.D.C. 1995), aff\u2019d, \n85 F.3d 689 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (ordering reinstatement of foreign service officer removed in \nviolation of for-cause protection); Pelicone v. Hodges, 320 F.2d 754, 757 (D.C. Cir. 1963) (holding \nthat plaintiff is \u201centitled to reinstatement\u201d); Paroczay, 219 F. Supp. at 94. \nHistory confirms the Court\u2019s authority to order restoration of invalidly removed officers. \nFor centuries, courts acting under the writ of mandamus have ordered plaintiffs be restored to \npublic offices from which they were wrongfully removed. See, e.g., Thomas Tapping, The Law \n \n8 The government tries to distinguish Swan because it addresses the question of Article III standing, \nbut this attempted distinction misunderstands Swan\u2019s relevance. Gov\u2019t Br. 19 n.4. Swan held, after \nsurveying caselaw on the authority of courts to enjoin the President, that the court had authority to \nissue adequate relief even absent an injunction requiring \u201cofficial reinstatement by the President.\u201d \n100 F.3d at 980. That is exactly the kind of relief that Special Counsel Dellinger seeks. Separately, \nthe court concluded that the officer at issue was not protected by any express for-cause removal \nprovision. Id. at 981. But \u00a7 1211(b) provides such express protection for the Special Counsel. \n21 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/24/25     Page 32 of 40\nand Practice of the High Prerogative Writ of Mandamus as it Obtains Both in England and in \nIreland 221 (1853) (\u201cThe writ of mandamus . . . has been by a great number of cases held to be \ngrantable, as well to admit him who has a right as to restore him who has been wrongfully \ndisplaced, to any office . . . .\u201d); John Shortt, Informations (Criminal and Quo Warranto), \nMandamus and Prohibitions 302 (1888) (identifying \u201cmandamus to restore\u201d as a remedy available \nto  plaintiffs  \u201cwrongfully  dispossessed  of  any  office\u201d);  Samuel  Slaughter  Merrill,  Law  of \nMandamus \u00a7 148 (1892) (\u201cWhen an officer has been wrongfully removed from his office, he will \nbe restored thereto by the writ of mandamus.\u201d). And courts of law have similarly recognized \nproceedings in quo warranto as \u201ca plain, speedy, and adequate\u201d remedy in law \u201cfor trying the title \nto office.\u201d Delgado v. Chavez, 140 U.S. 586, 590 (1891); see also, e.g., Newman v. United States \nex rel. Frizzell, 238 U.S. 537, 544 (1915) (\u201cThe writ thus came to be used as a means of \ndetermining which of two claimants was entitled to an office .... \u201d). This longstanding procedure \nvests courts with the traditional remedial authority \u201cnot only to oust the respondent [officer] but \nalso to install the relator [officer].\u201d Floyd R. Mechem, A Treatise on the Law of Public Offices and \nOfficers \u00a7 496 (1890); e.g., Boyd v. Nebraska, 143 U.S. 135, 151 (1892); United States ex rel. \nCrawford v. Addison, 73 U.S. 291, 297 (1867) (observing that upon judgment of ouster, \u201crelator \nthereupon became entitled to the office\u201d). \nThe cases cited by the government confirm rather than undermine this point. See In re \nSawyer, 124 U.S. 200 (1888); White v. Berry, 171 U.S. 366 (1898). As the Supreme Court wrote \nin Sawyer, \u201cThe jurisdiction to determine the title to a public office . . . is exercised either by . . . \nmandamus, prohibition, quo warranto, or information in the nature of a writ of quo warranto, \naccording to . . . the mode of procedure, established by the common law or by statute.\u201d Sawyer, \n124 U.S. at 212; see also id. at 213, 216, 220 (same); White, 171 U.S. at 377 (identifying \n22 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/24/25     Page 33 of 40\n\u201cmandamus, prohibition, quo warranto, or information in the nature of a writ of quo warranto\u201d). \nThe government\u2019s other authorities say the same, or rested on the conceptually distinct point that \nfederal courts should abstain from adjudicating state offices. See, e.g., Walton v. House of \nRepresentatives of State of Okl., 265 U.S. 487, 490 (1924) (eligibility of state representative); \nHarkrader v. Wadley, 172 U.S. 148, 165 (1898) (declining to enjoin state criminal proceeding). \n  To be sure, the government tries to disclaim quo warranto as a relevant analogue on the \nbasis that it has been historically viewed as a \u201clegal rather than an equitable remedy.\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. \n18. But the Supreme Court in Sawyer and White divided legal and equitable remedies because \nthose cases were \u201cdecided before the simplification of the rules of pleading and, more importantly, \nbefore the merger of law and equity.\u201d Stern v. S. Chester Tube Co., 390 U.S. 606, 608-10 (1968). \nNow, \u201cthere is only one action . . . in which all claims may be joined and all remedies are \navailable.\u201d Ross v. Bernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 539 (1970). Further, in the 100-plus years since \nSawyer and White were decided, the Supreme Court has approved court-ordered reinstatements to \npositions in the Executive Branch. See, e.g., Webster v. Doe, 486 U.S. 592, 604-05 (1988) \n(rejecting government\u2019s position that, on remand, courts lacked authority to \u201corder respondent\u2019s \nreinstatement,\u201d approvingly citing \u201ctraditional equitable principles\u201d); Vitarelli v. Seaton, 359 U.S. \n535, 546 (1959) (holding Department of the Interior employee \u201cis entitled to the reinstatement \nwhich he seeks\u201d). And the government\u2019s categorical \u201cno-reinstatement\u201d rule cannot be reconciled \nwith the Supreme Court\u2019s later recognition that, where warranted, courts have \u201cinjunctive power\u201d \nto reinstate executive employees. Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 92 n.68 (1974). There is thus \nno present-day basis for the government\u2019s antiquated view of pleadings and remedies.9  \n \n9 In the same vein, the government does not contest the courts\u2019 authority to adjudicate the title to \npublic office under quo warranto but objects that Special Counsel Dellinger did not plead quo \nwarranto in his complaint. Gov\u2019t Br. 18. However, in cases involving removal from office, \u201cthe \n23 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/24/25     Page 34 of 40\nNor does the government succeed in deriving a \u201cbackpay-only\u201d rule from a handful of prior \ncases involving removed officers. A litigant\u2019s choices about what remedy to seek in prior litigation \ntactics have nothing to do with the court\u2019s authority to issue a remedy. In any event, one analogous \nlitigant (Myron Wiener) originally did sue for reinstatement, and filed suit for backpay only after \nCongress\u2019s abolition of the War Claims Commission mooted his request to be reinstated to it. \nWiener v. United States, 357 U.S. 349, 350 (1958); Br. for United States, 1957 WL 87809, at *13-\n14 (Oct. 15, 1957). As to Mr. Humphrey, the government does not dispute that he was dead when \na legal challenge to his removal was first filed. See Humphrey\u2019s Executor, 295 U.S. at 612; see \nGov\u2019t Br. 16 n.3. Were there doubt, the parties\u2019 briefs confirm this timing. Br. for Executor, 1935 \nWL 32964, at *2-3 (Mar. 19, 1935) (explaining that Humphrey\u2019s estate first challenged his \nremoval on April 28, 1934, two months after his death). And Mr. Myers\u2014who was deceased at \nthe time of a final judgment\u2014saw his term of office expire in July 1921, only months after he first \nsued and years before the trial court heard his case. See Myers v. United States, 58 Ct. Cl. 199, \n202-03 (1923), aff\u2019d, 272 U.S. 52 (1926). Reinstatement would have been moot at that point. \nAccordingly, the government\u2019s effort to craft a back-pay-only rule from these cases ignores the \nfacts and context of these proceedings. \nNext, the government disputes the Court\u2019s remedial authority on the ground that there is \nno \u201cprevious case in which a court ordered the reinstatement of single agency head after removal \n \nCourt is to broadly construe\u201d the request for relief, Severino v. Biden, 581 F. Supp. 3d 110, 116 \n(D.D.C. 2022), aff\u2019d, 71 F.4th 1038 (D.C. Cir. 2023), and may grant any remedy necessary to \naccord the plaintiff relief (or may instead grant leave to amend), Swan, 100 F.3d at 980. Moreover, \nD.C. Code \u00a7 16-3501 expressly authorizes Special Counsel Dellinger as an \u201cinterested person\u201d to \nseek a writ from this court. See Newman, 238 U.S. at 546 (distinguishing between a \u201cthird person\u201d \nand \u201cinterested person\u201d). A prior request to the U.S. Attorney General would have been both futile \nand inadequate. See, e.g., Honig v. Doe, 484 U.S. 305, 326-27 (1988); see Gov\u2019t Br. 18. \n24 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/24/25     Page 35 of 40\nby the President.\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. 18. But there have not been any such cases involving an official \nremoved without cause, principally because Presidents have not historically violated for-cause \nremoval restrictions. Of course, President Biden removed the Commissioner of the Social Security \nAdministration, but the removed commissioner did not choose to contest that determination in \ncourt (perhaps because the OLC\u2019s position after Collins\u2014a position that distinguished the OLC\u2014\nseemed likely to prevail if tested in the Judiciary). See Constitutionality of the Commissioner of \nSocial Security\u2019s Tenure Protection, 2021 WL 2981542, at *6 n.3, *9 (O.L.C. July 8, 2021). Any \nabsence of on-point authority thus cuts both ways and certainly does not support the government.  \nRegardless, the more sensible lesson to derive from past practice is that reinstatement \nremedies have long been perceived as inherent and integral to the statutory framework for \nindependent agencies. As explained above, Special Counsel Dellinger challenges his removal by \nreference to a statutory provision that seeks to secure a measure of agency independence from \ndirect political control. See Dellinger, 2025 WL 471022, at *6. It is appropriate for this Court to \ncraft equitable remedies by reference to that statutory scheme. See CIGNA Corp. v. Amara, 563 \nU.S.  421,  444-45  (2011)  (defining  the  district  court\u2019s  remedy  by  reference  to  \u201cequitable \nprinciples[] as modified by the obligations and injuries identified by ERISA itself\u201d); Porter v. \nWarner Holding Co., 328 U.S. 395, 398 (1946) (\u201c[S]ince the public interest is involved in a \nproceeding of this nature, those equitable powers assume an even broader and more flexible \ncharacter than when only a private controversy is at stake.\u201d); Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.S. 321, \n331 (1944) (\u201c[D]iscretion under [the statutory provision authorizing relief\u200a] must be exercised in \nlight of the large objectives of the\u201d statute, \u201c[f\u200a]or the standards of the public interest[,] not the \nrequirements of private litigation[,] measure the propriety and need for injunctive relief in these \ncases.\u201d). Attention to the statutory scheme, in turn, clarifies the proper remedial framework. In \n25 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/24/25     Page 36 of 40\ndesigning the OSC, Congress undertook to safeguard covered officials against removal without \ncause. It follows from this statutory plan that officials removed without cause can seek a judicial \norder (just like the one issued here) providing for their continuance in the relevant office. \nTo hold otherwise would reduce for-cause removal statutes to rubble. On the government\u2019s \nview, a President could fire independent agency officials at will and, at most, months or years later, \nafter final judgment and appeal, those fired officials might be able to recover some backpay from \nthe Treasury . . . but nothing more. On this logic, a century of ink and energy devoted to agency \nindependence has been a colossal misadventure: all it would cost is a few thousand dollars from \nthe U.S. Treasury for a President to buy his way out of for-cause removal restrictions. Rather than \ninfer that so many Presidents, legislators, courts, scholars, and agency officials misunderstood how \nfor-cause removal restrictions work\u2014namely, to keep covered officials in office unless they are \nproperly terminated\u2014the more natural inference is that equity permits courts to afford continuance \nor reinstatement remedies as necessary to effectuate these longstanding statutory safeguards.  \nFinally, and alternatively, even if the government is correct that this Court cannot issue \nan order against subordinate executive officials to provide Special Counsel Dellinger with the \nprivileges and authorities of the Special Counsel, partial summary judgment would still be \nappropriate. First, the Court could still issue a declaratory judgment that Hampton Dellinger is the \nproper head of the OSC. See, e.g., United States v. Wilson, 290 F.3d 347, 362 (D.C. Cir. 2002) \n(declaring that appellee \u201cis a member of the United States Commission on Civil Rights \u2018with all \nthe powers, privileges, and emoluments thereunto of right appertaining\u2019\u201d); Borak v. Biddle, 141 \nF.2d 278, 281 (D.C. Cir. 1944); see also Nat\u2019l Treasury Emps. Union v. Nixon, 492 F.2d 587, 616 \n(D.C. Cir. 1974) (issuing a declaratory judgment against the President); Clinton v. City of New \nYork, 524 U.S. 417, 433 n.22 (1998) (an action \u201ctraceable to the President\u2019s\u201d decisions \u201cwould be \n26 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/24/25     Page 37 of 40\nredressed by a declaratory judgment that the [actions] are invalid\u201d). Second, and once again \nseparate of the requested injunctive and declaratory relief, this Court may award Special Counsel \nDellinger backpay, which would require it to hold that his termination was unlawful. Compl. 14. \nB.  The Permanent Injunction Factors Strongly Favor Relief \nSpecial Counsel Dellinger has previously explained the irreparable harms he would suffer \nin both his personal and official capacities if he is removed from office: most notably, he would \nbe deprived of the statutory right to function in his office, and deprivation of that statutory right \nwould cause immeasurable and irreparable damage to the OSC at this especially fraught time for \nthe federal civil service. E.g., ECF 12 at 4-7; ECF 21 at 9. In its opinion granting the TRO, this \nCourt thoroughly addressed each of those harms and explained in detail why the government\u2019s \nauthority did not carry the day. Dellinger, 2025 WL 471022, at *9-13. Since that decision, Judge \nContreras has followed this Court\u2019s careful analysis to reach a similar finding of irreparable harm \nto a member of the MSPB removed in violation of an express for-cause removal protection. See \nHarris v. Bessent, No. 25 Civ. 412, 2025 WL 521027, at *6-9 (D.D.C. Feb. 18, 2025). \nThe government does not refute the Court\u2019s analysis; instead, it mostly repeats the same \npoints that this Court has already rejected. Compare Gov\u2019t Br. 20-21, with Dellinger, 2025 WL \n471022, at *9-13 (addressing Sampson, Berry, and English). The government\u2019s sole new argument \nis to analogize Special Counsel Dellinger\u2019s deprivation of the statutory right to function in his \noffice to suits filed by small numbers of congressional representatives in which courts rejected a \ntheory of Article III \u201clegislative standing.\u201d See Gov\u2019t Br. 20 (citing Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, \n820 (1997); Barnes v. Kline, 759 F.2d 21, 50 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (Bork, J., dissenting)). But those \ncases do not stand for the broad principle that a public official can never sue to vindicate an \nirreparable institutional injury on behalf of a government office. Rather, they stand for the much \n27 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/24/25     Page 38 of 40\nnarrower proposition that individual representatives in a legislative body generally lack standing \nto vindicate the institutional interests of the whole body. See Ariz. State Legislature v. Ariz. Indep. \nRedistricting Comm\u2019n, 576 U.S. 787, 802-04 (2015); see Comm. on Judiciary of U.S. House of \nRepresentatives v. McGahn, 968 F.3d 755, 763-66 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (en banc). Here, in contrast, \nSpecial Counsel Dellinger was appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate to lead the \nOSC, and so is uniquely situated to vindicate his office\u2019s statutory right to function with a modest \ndegree of independence. The government\u2019s further argument that Special Counsel Dellinger has \nno right to exercise authority absent presidential approval, Gov\u2019t Br. 20, rests on the predicate \nassumption that it will prevail on the merits. As discussed above, the government is wrong. \nFurther, as this Court has concluded, a post-judgment award of monetary damages would \nbe an inadequate remedy for Special Counsel Dellinger\u2019s irreparable loss of his statutory right to \nfunction in office: \u201c[P]laintiff\u2019s irreparable injury cannot be compared to the loss of income or \nembarrassment involved in the typical employment action, for which there are remedies that do \nnot involve equitable relief. This case falls outside of the typical paradigm since the OSC is an \nindependent agency and the White House is not plaintiff\u2019s employer.\u201d Dellinger, 2025 471022, at \n*10; see also Sampson, 415 U.S. at 86 n.58, 92 n.68 (explaining that monetary damages alone \nwould be inadequate in \u201cextraordinary\u201d cases outside \u201croutine\u201d loss of employment). \nFinally, the balance of the equities and the public interest strongly favor the relief sought \nby Special Counsel Dellinger. The government asserts a \u201cgreat and irreparable harm to the \nExecutive,\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. 21, but that same reasoning has not yet carried the day in any court to hear \nthe case\u2014and is unconvincing on its terms, since it amounts to a restatement of the government\u2019s \nview of the merits of the case, rather than a distinct explanation for why its position is correct. On \nthe flip side of the equation, \u201c[t]here is generally no public interest in the perpetuation of unlawful \n28 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/24/25     Page 39 of 40\nagency action.\u201d League of Women Voters of United States v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 12 (D.C. Cir. \n2016). Instead, there is a \u201csubstantial public interest\u201d in the Executive Branch abiding by federal \nlaw. Id. at 12; Harris, 2025 WL 521027, at *9 (same). \nThe government separately argues that reinstating Special Counsel Dellinger\u2014who was \nlawfully appointed and confirmed to his office\u2014would cause confusion that could later invalidate \nactions by the OSC. Gov\u2019t Br. 22-23 (citing Collins, 594 U.S. at 259). But in light of the OSC\u2019s \nnarrow jurisdiction and inability to regulate private parties, it is unclear who the government thinks \ncould file suit to invalidate the OSC\u2019s actions (as a private party did in Collins). Regardless, any \nfault for confusion over the OSC\u2019s authority rests with the government, which refuses to comply \nwith the plain terms of a 50-year-old statute. See Dellinger, 2025 WL 471022, at *10 & n.5; Order \nat 1, No. 25 Civ. 385 (D.D.C. Feb. 13, 2025), ECF 19. \nThe public interest in enforcing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b) is particularly strong today. Congress \nestablished the Special Counsel to protect whistleblowers and federal employees victimized by \nprohibited personnel practices. As Congress and two Presidents recognized, \u201c[i]ndependence is \nessential to any Special Counsel\u2019s ability to perform the unique set of duties and reporting \nrequirements set forth in the statute.\u201d Dellinger, 2025 WL 471022, at *13. That independence has \nnever  been  more  important  given  the  historic  upheaval  currently  occurring  within  federal \nemployment and the continued need to ensure that whistleblowers are guarded from reprisal. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons above, Special Counsel Dellinger\u2019s cross-motion for summary judgment \nshould be granted, the government\u2019s motion for summary judgment should be denied, and the \nCourt should issue declaratory and permanent injunctive relief to Special Counsel Dellinger. \n  \n29 \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 24     Filed 02/24/25     Page 40 of 40\n  Respectfully submitted,  \n \n \n    /s/ Joshua A.

ROBERTS, CHIEF JUSTICE OF THE UNITED STATES AND \nCIRCUIT JUSTICE FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT: \n \nThe government devotes most of its application to argumentation over weighty \nand complex questions of constitutional law and remedy. On its framing of the issues, \nthe merits are everything and appellate jurisdiction is a mere afterthought. But that \ngets things backward. As the D.C. Circuit emphasized, a two-day appeal from the \nissuance of a TRO\u2014which was itself issued just two days after this suit was first filed, \nand which will expire by its terms eight days after the Court receives this opposition \nbrief\u2014is not a proper vehicle through which to resolve separation-of-powers disputes.  \nYet that does not deter the government, which openly solicits the Court to \ncreate an Article II exception to the general rule that TROs cannot be appealed. The \ngovernment even offers an initial list of TROs it might wish to appeal on the basis \nthat they allegedly infringe Article II prerogatives. In that sense, \u201cthis wolf comes as \na wolf.\u201d Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 699 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting). For \ngenerations, including  in  untold  cases  involving  government defendants,  federal \ncourts have adhered to the principle that TROs generally cannot be appealed unless \nthey function as preliminary injunctions. That rule protects core judicial interests in \norderly administration and sound deliberation; it also avoids needless inter-branch \nconflict and premature escalation of politically fraught disputes. But as evidenced by \nthis very case\u2014which reached the Supreme Court less than six days after it was first \nfiled\u2014the government now prefers a new arrangement. To accept its theory and grant \nits request for relief would be to invite more of the same: a rocket docket straight to \nthis Court, even as high-stakes emergency litigation proliferates across the country.  \n  1 \n\n \nIn any event, the government\u2019s case for carving out a jurisdictional exception \nhere is uniquely weak. First, contrary to the government\u2019s assertions, no injunctive \nrelief has been ordered against the President, so this case does not evoke the special \nsolicitude sometimes afforded to that office. Second, the government has conceded \nhere  that  it  violated  a  directly  applicable  statute  which  no  federal  court  has \nenjoined\u2014and we are unaware of any case where this Court has granted emergency \nrelief (let alone from an ordinarily unappealable TRO) so that the government can \ncontinue to violate a federal statute. This is precisely the kind of circumstance in \nwhich a TRO that preserves the status quo ante is properly entered while the parties \nbrief (and the courts evaluate) the merits of the constitutional questions. Third, the \ngovernment seeks such an extraordinary intervention despite genuine disputes over \nopen legal issues (some of which it failed to develop below)\u2014and despite failing to \nidentify any concrete, irreversible harm from maintenance of the TRO over the next \neight days. Finally, the government has not identified any reason to doubt that the \ndistrict court is proceeding swiftly and ably. In fact, the district court has set a highly \nexpedited schedule to resolve the merits, and may well decide the case in ways that \navoid any need for this Court\u2019s intervention (or at least create a proper record for it). \nAt bottom, there is no merit to the government\u2019s effort to declare a five-alarm \nfire based on a short-lived TRO that preserves the status quo ante as prescribed by a \nhalf-century-old statute. Courts regularly deny stays pending appeal based on similar \nclaims of injury to abstract Article II interests, and there is certainly no good reason \nto treat this circumstance as an exception to the general rule against appealing TROs.  \n  2 \n\n \nSeparate of those considerations, the government\u2019s application should also be \ndenied for three additional reasons: the government is not likely to succeed on the \nmerits of its position; the government has failed to demonstrate irreparable injury in \nthe absence of a stay; and the balance of the equities cuts firmly against relief. We \naddress each of these points for the sake of completeness, subject to the caveat that \nthis case is just eight days old and both the parties and the lower courts are still \ngrappling with the issues (as evidenced, in part, by the government\u2019s presentation of \narguments here that it barely developed\u2014and that no court addressed\u2014below). Of \ncourse, that is one reason why courts are so reluctant to authorize appeals of TROs, \nand it reflects the adverse consequences of the government\u2019s shoot-the-moon tactics. \nBACKGROUND \nA.  The United States Office of Special Counsel \n1.  The Founding and Mission of the OSC \nThe  Office  of  Special  Counsel  (\u201cOSC\u201d)  is  an  independent  federal  agency, \noriginally established by the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (\u201cCSRA\u201d). See 5 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1211(a). The CSRA was enacted to address widespread public concerns about the \nfederal  civil  service\u2014including  evidence  that  it  was  vulnerable  to  political \nmanipulation and failed to protect whistleblowers. See Developments in the Law\u2014\nPublic Employment, 97 Harv. L. Rev. 1619, 1631-32 (1984). The CSRA began with \nPresident Carter, who recommended creating a Special Counsel, \u201cappointed by the \nPresident and confirmed by the Senate\u201d to investigate abuses of civil service laws, \nand the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d), a nonpartisan board removable \nonly for cause to adjudicate those disputes. See Federal Civil Service Reform Message \n  3 \n\n \nto the Congress (Mar. 2, 1978). This structure, President Carter explained, would \n\u201cguarantee  independent  and  impartial  protection  to  employees\u201d  and  thereby \n\u201csafeguard the rights of Federal employees who \u2018blow the whistle\u2019 on violations of \nlaws or regulations by other employees, including their supervisors.\u201d Id. \nCongress accepted President Carter\u2019s proposal, including the MSPB and the \nSpecial Counsel with for-cause removal protections. See S. 2640, 95th Cong. (Mar. 3, \n1978); H.R. Rep. No. 95-1403, at 388 (1978) (supp. views of Rep. S. Solarz). Congress \nmade an express finding that \u201cthe authority and power of the Special Counsel\u201d was \nrequired to \u201cinvestigate allegations involving prohibited personnel practices and \nreprisals against Federal employees.\u201d Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, \u00a7 3(4), Pub. \nL. No. 95\u2013454, 92 Stat. 1112. Consistent with this vision, Congress provided that the \nSpecial Counsel could be removed \u201cby the President only for inefficiency, neglect of \nduty,  or  malfeasance  in  office.\u201d  Civil  Service  Reform  Act  of  1978,  \u00a7 1204.  This \nprovision drew an initial objection from the U.S. Department of Justice Office of Legal \nCounsel (\u201cOLC\u201d), which President Carter effectively overruled when he subsequently \nsigned  the  law  and  declared  it  would  create  \u201ca  new  system  of  excellence  and \naccountability.\u201d  Compare  Memorandum  Opinion  for  the  General  Counsel,  Civil \nService Commission, 2 Op. O.L.C. 120 (1978), with President Jimmy Carter Remarks \non Signing the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 into Law (Oct. 13, 1978).1 \nIn 1988, Congress again grew concerned that federal whistleblowers were not \nadequately protected, and crafted the Whistleblower Protection Act to \u201cstrengthen \n \n1 The OLC opinion referenced here was requested not by President Carter but instead by the Civil \nService Commission, which would be replaced in the proposed CSRA. 2 Op. O.L.C. at 120. \n  4 \n\n \nand improve protection for the rights of Federal employees, to prevent reprisals, and \nto help eliminate wrongdoing within the Government.\u201d Whistleblower Protection Act \nof 1989, \u00a7 2(b), Pub. L. No. 101\u201312, 103 Stat. 16. \nAs originally drafted, the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1988 separated the \nOSC from the MSPB, establishing the OSC as an independent agency. The original \ndraft also vested the OSC with new powers. President Reagan, however, pocket \nvetoed this legislation, objecting to several new authorities that the legislation would \nvest in the OSC\u2014singling out the authority to seek judicial review of adverse MSPB \ndecisions in federal court, which would \u201cpermit[] the Executive branch to litigate \nagainst itself.\u201d Memorandum of Disapproval on a Bill Concerning Whistleblower \nProtection (Oct. 26, 1988). President Reagan also suggested hesitancy about the bill\u2019s \nfor-cause removal protections, which were identical to those already in effect. Id. \nAfter the pocket veto, Congress worked with Presidents Reagan and Bush to \naddress their separation-of-powers concerns. After these negotiations, the revised \nbill\u2014the enacted Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989\u2014no longer authorized the \nOSC to pursue litigation against other agencies in federal court. See 135 Cong. Rec. \n5012, 5036-38 (Mar. 21, 1989) (statement of Rep. P. Schroeder) (\u201c[W]e agreed to make \nthe changes requested by the administration to clip the special counsel\u2019s wings.\u201d); id. \nat  5039  (statement  of  Rep.  S.  Parris)  (\u201cAs  amended,  S.  20  would  resolve  the \nadministration\u2019s  constitutional  concerns  by  eliminating  the  right  of  the  special \ncounsel to sue in Federal court.\u201d).  \n  5 \n\n \nBut those negotiations did not displace the OSC\u2019s status as an independent \nagency or its existing for-cause removal provision. As the House Subcommittee on \nCivil Service stated, federal employees required \u201cassurance that the Office of Special \nCounsel is a safe haven,\u201d because otherwise it \u201ccan never be effective in protecting \nvictims of prohibited personnel practices.\u201d Id. at 5034 (Joint Explanatory Statement); \nid. at 5032 (statement of Rep. G. Sikorski) (\u201cUntil whistleblowers are confident that \nthe Office of Special Counsel is on their side, that office will not be an effective \nadvocate for their cause.\u201d). Following this inter-branch agreement on the importance \nof maintaining a measure of independence for the OSC, President Bush\u2019s Attorney \nGeneral thanked the bill\u2019s sponsor for \u201cforg[ing] a mutually acceptable resolution of \nour serious constitutional concerns\u201d and \u201cpledge[d]\u201d to lobby for the Act as drafted. \nSee Letter from Office of the Attorney General to Sen. Levin dated Mar. 3, 1989, 135 \nCong. Rec. 5012, 5033-34. \nUltimately, President Bush agreed that the revisions had \u201caddressed\u201d the \n\u201cconstitutional concerns\u201d he and President Reagan had raised about the Act. See \nGeorge H.W. Bush, Remarks on Signing the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989 \n(Apr. 10, 1989). Indeed, he specifically praised that the Act would \u201cenhance the \nauthority of the Office of Special Counsel to protect whistle-blowers,\u201d and that it \n\u201cretain[ed] current law which provides that the Special Counsel may only be removed \nfor inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance.\u201d Id. Rather than reserve the question \nor call this provision into doubt, President Bush thus made apparent his approval of \n  6 \n\n \nthe for-cause removal limitation, which reflected a deliberate inter-branch settlement \nof constitutional issues (and which was essential to the OSC\u2019s core purpose). \n2.  The OSC\u2019s Limited Jurisdiction and Functions \nAs contemplated by Congress and two Presidents in the enactments described \nabove, the OSC maintains a unique and partly independent position to protect federal \nemployees  from  prohibited  personnel  practices  (\u201cPPPs\u201d)\u2014especially  reprisal  for \nwhistleblowing. The OSC also affords a secure channel for employees to blow the \nwhistle on wrongdoing. And it assists Congress\u2019s legislative and oversight agendas. \nTo be clear, none of the OSC\u2019s authorities empowers it to regulate or penalize \nprivate activity. Instead, as an \u201combudsman\u201d and \u201cwatchdog,\u201d Frazier v. Merit Sys. \nProt.  Bd.,  672  F.2d  150,  162-63  (D.C.  Cir.  1982),  the  OSC  has  \u201conly  limited \njurisdiction to enforce certain rules governing Federal Government employers and \nemployees,\u201d Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau, 591 U.S. 197, 221 (2020). \nEven as to federal employees, moreover, the OSC does not impose any discipline or \nother adverse action. Instead, the OSC receives allegations of PPPs and Hatch Act \nviolations, assesses and investigates such complaints, and promotes a proper course \nof action. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1212(a), 1216(c). Where the OSC finds that an allegation \nwas warranted, it first works with the relevant agency head to encourage voluntary \ncorrective action and relief for the PPP victim (or voluntary discipline from an agency \nhead in the case of a Hatch Act violation). However, any recommended action by the \nOSC may be rejected: the Special Counsel has no power to bind any other agency. \nAbsent  voluntary  settlement,  the  OSC  may  petition  the  MSPB  on  the  injured \n  7 \n\n \nemployee\u2019s behalf. Id. \u00a7 1214. But an injured employee may also petition the MSPB \ndirectly (subject to certain procedural requirements). Id. \u00a7 1221.  \nIn  addition,  the  OSC  can  refer  a  complaint  to  the  MSPB,  asking  that  a \nperpetrator of a PPP or Hatch Act violation be disciplined. See id. \u00a7\u00a7 1215, 1216. In \nsuch circumstances, the OSC exercises no authority over the MSPB, which is an \nindependent adjudicatory agency whose members separately enjoy for-cause removal \nprotections. Id. \u00a7 1202(d). \u201c[T]he MSPB is free to disagree with the Special Counsel \nand often does.\u201d Am. Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Emps., AFL-CIO v. O\u2019Connor (\u201cAFGE\u201d), 747 F.2d \n748, 753 (D.C. Cir. 1984). In that respect, the MSPB supervises the OSC\u2019s exercise of \nauthority to refer complaints and makes its own decisions. Similarly, while the OSC \nhas limited authority to issue subpoenas, only the MSPB can seek to enforce such \nsubpoenas. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1212(b)(3)(A). Thus, as the D.C. Circuit has explained, \u201cthe \nSpecial Counsel\u2019s \u2018seemingly broad powers are greatly circumscribed in practice, [in \npart] by the Special Counsel\u2019s lack of authority to require either the Board or other \nagencies to do its bidding.\u2019\u201d AFGE, 747 F.2d at 753 (quoting 97 Harv. L. Rev. at 1643). \nEven when the MSPB chooses to impose discipline, the maximum \u201ccivil penalty\u201d it \ncan issue is $1,330. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1216(a)(3); 5 CFR \u00a7 1201.126(a). And any decision by \nthe  MSPB  is  subject  to  judicial  review  in  federal  court.  5  U.S.C.  \u00a7\u00a7 1214(c)(2), \n1215(a)(4), 7703(b). The OSC cannot participate in any litigation in any Article III \ncourt, except in a limited role as amicus curiae. See id. \u00a7 1212(h). \nBeyond its human-resources investigative role, the Whistleblower Protection \nAct  authorizes  the  OSC  to  receive  reports  from  employee-whistleblowers  within \n  8 \n\n \nagencies. See id. \u00a7 1213(a). However, if a report appears credible, the OSC cannot \nconduct its own investigation or otherwise take direct action on the report. Instead, \nit may only review the investigation conducted by the whistleblower\u2019s agency, and \nthen report the investigation and the OSC\u2019s own assessment of it to Congress and the \nPresident.  See id.  \u00a7\u00a7 1212(a)(3),  1213(c)-(e).  The  Special  Counsel  must  keep  the \nidentity of any whistleblower strictly confidential. Id. \u00a7 1213(h).2 \nThe OSC is also vested with limited authority to \u201cprescribe . . . regulations,\u201d \nalthough this authority is strictly and statutorily limited only to internal matters \n\u201cnecessary to perform the functions of the Special Counsel.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1212(e). The Special \nCounsel may separately issue nonbinding advisory opinions concerning the Hatch \nAct, but he has no rulemaking authority that compels compliance. Id. \u00a7 1212(f); see \nalso, e.g., AFGE, 747 F.2d at 752 (\u201c[T]he advice the Special Counsel is permitted to \ngive  creates  no  law  and  binds  neither  the  public  nor  any  agency  or  officer  of \ngovernment.\u201d); Authority for Issuing Hatch Act Regulations, 18 Op. O.L.C. 1, 1 (1994). \nFinally, virtually every action taken by the OSC\u2014from receipt of allegations, \nto investigations, to agreed corrective actions, to complaints in the MSPB\u2014must be \ndirectly reported to Congress to inform important legislative functions, including \noversight and legislation in this space. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1217, 1218. \n \n \n2 In a similarly advisory capacity, the OSC reviews regulations issued by the Office of Personnel \nManagement for any rule that would require committing a PPP. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1212(a)(4). \n  9 \n\n \nB.  Procedural History \nPlaintiff Hampton Dellinger has served as Special Counsel since March 6, \n2024, following his nomination by the President and confirmation by the Senate to a \nfive-year term. On February 7, 2025, at 7:22 PM, Special Counsel Dellinger received \nan email from Sergio Gor, Assistant to the President and Director of the White House \nPresidential Personnel Office, that stated: \u201cOn behalf of President Donald J. Trump, \nI am writing to inform you that your position as Special Counsel of the US Office of \nSpecial Counsel is terminated, effective immediately. Thank you for your service[.]\u201d \nEx. A to Compl., No. 25 Civ. 385 (D.D.C. Feb. 10, 2025), ECF 1-1. \nOn Monday morning, February 10, 2025, Special Counsel Dellinger filed a \ncomplaint and simultaneously sought a temporary restraining order to preserve the \nstatus quo ante pending further proceedings.3 That afternoon, the district court held \nan in-person hearing, where the government did not appear fully prepared to address \nthe Court\u2019s questions. The district court proposed that the government \u201cextend the \neffective date of the President\u2019s proposed action while [the parties] brief [the motion],\u201d \nbut the government refused that proposal. Feb. 10, 2025 Tr. (\u201cTr.\u201d) 3:1-18, No. 25 Civ. \n385 (D.D.C.), ECF 9. The government then requested leave to file an opposition the \nnext day to Special Counsel Dellinger\u2019s TRO application. Id. 27:23-24. The district \ncourt agreed, noting that it may issue an administrative stay to preserve the status \nquo ante while it decided the TRO application. Id. 25:8-11, 25:17-20. That evening, \n \n3 Special Counsel Dellinger sought, and received, a TRO only against defendants Bessent, Gor, \nGorman, Kammann, and Vought, not the President. See App. 42a n.1; TRO Motion at 1-2, Dellinger v. \nBessent, 2025 WL 471022 (Feb. 10, 2025). \n  10 \n\n \nthe  district  court  issued  a  three-day  administrative  stay,  ordering  that  Special \nCounsel Dellinger be allowed to continue to serve in his position through midnight on \nFebruary 13, 2025. See Order, No. 25 Civ. 385 (D.D.C. Feb. 10, 2025, 8:20 PM). \nThe next morning, the government filed in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nD.C. Circuit a motion for an emergency stay pending appeal. No. 25-5025 (D.C. Cir. \nFeb. 11, 2025), ECF 4. One day later, Special Counsel Dellinger filed a response. No. \n25-5025 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 12, 2025), ECF 7. That same evening, the D.C. Circuit denied \nthe government\u2019s motion and sua sponte dismissed the government\u2019s appeal, holding \nunanimously that the court lacked appellate jurisdiction over the administrative stay \nand  that  the  government  was  not  entitled  to  mandamus  relief.  See  App.  1a-2a \n(Katsas, Childs, Pan, JJ.). Judge Katsas issued a concurring opinion. See id. at 3a. \nEven later that night, the district court granted Special Counsel Dellinger\u2019s \nTRO application. App. 29a. Consistent with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65, the \ndistrict court limited its TRO to a fourteen-day period and scheduled a hearing on \nFebruary 26 to decide whether to issue \u201can appealable preliminary injunction.\u201d Id. at \n30a. The government responded to that order by filing a notice of appeal and a second \nemergency stay application in the D.C. Circuit. The government also filed a second \nstay application in the district court, which the district court denied the next day \nwhile reaffirming that it would \u201ccontinue to act with extreme expedition,\u201d App. 32a. \nConsistent with that commitment, the district court issued an order two days \nlater consolidating consideration of a preliminary injunction with consideration of the \nmerits. Order, No. 25 Civ. 385 (D.D.C. Feb. 15, 2025, 4:27 PM). It also adopted an \n  11 \n\n \nexpedited schedule by which all issues will be briefed by February 27, 2025, after \nwhich point it will issue an appealable final judgment in this matter. See id. By virtue \nof that schedule, the district court will have an opportunity to address the disputes \nhere with more fulsome briefing and weeks of study\u2014which was not possible when it \nfirst issued a TRO two days after the filing of the complaint, and which will render \nthe issue of interim relief irrelevant (given that it will adjudicate the ultimate merits).  \nShortly before midnight on Saturday, February 15, the D.C. Circuit denied the \ngovernment\u2019s second motion for an emergency stay and dismissed its appeal, again \nfinding that the government had failed to demonstrate appellate jurisdiction or the \npropriety of mandamus relief. App. 47a. The court began by observing that \u201cthe relief \nrequested by the government is a sharp departure from established procedures that \nbalance and protect the interests of litigants, and ensure the orderly consideration of \ncases before the district court and this court.\u201d App. 28a. In support of that sharp \ndeparture,  however,  the  government  advanced  only  \u201cunsubstantiated  claims  of \n\u2018extraordinary  harm\u2019\u201d  based  on  abstract  theories  of  injury  to  alleged  Article  II \ninterests. Id. To accept the government\u2019s view, the court reasoned, would be to invite \na \u201cdeluge of TRO appeals,\u201d each of which \u201cwould be litigated at a breakneck pace.\u201d Id. \nat 41a. It would be particularly imprudent to proceed that way, the court emphasized, \nbecause the government\u2019s position effectively smuggled the merits inquiry into the \nthreshold jurisdictional determination. See id. at 41a-42a. This approach would open \nthe floodgates to immediately appeal any TRO whenever any Article II interest is \nasserted\u2014or, alternatively, would require the adjudication of weighty and unresolved \n  12 \n\n \nconstitutional merits questions at the outset to assess the appealability of a TRO. Id. \nBecause such reasoning is at odds with precedent, the court rejected it, emphasizing \nthat the government had made no substantial showing of injury that could not be \nproperly remedied in the normal course following expiration of the TRO. See id. at \n43a-44a. Judge Katsas dissented. See id. at 48a-59a.  \nThe following morning\u2014merely six days after Special Counsel Dellinger first \nfiled suit, and with only ten days remaining before the TRO is set to expire\u2014the \ngovernment asked this Court to vacate the TRO and enter an administrative stay. \nARGUMENT \nTo obtain the relief that it requests, the government must show that this Court \nis reasonably likely to grant review of the ruling below, that there is a fair prospect \nit will reverse that ruling, that irreparable harm will likely result without emergency \nrelief, and that the equities and relative balance of harms to the parties favor relief. \nSee, e.g., Hollingsworth v. Perry, 558 U.S. 183, 190 (2010). Because the D.C. Circuit \ndismissed this appeal for lack of appellate jurisdiction, the government faces an \nespecially high bar: it must not only show that this Court would likely review and \nreverse that jurisdictional ruling, but also that this Court would further reach and \nresolve the merits of the underlying stay application in its favor. As demonstrated \nbelow, it cannot make any of those showings. So its application should be denied. \nI.  This Court Is Unlikely to Review or Reverse the D.C. Circuit\u2019s Holding \nThat It Lacked Appellate Jurisdiction to Review the TRO  \nIn addressing its likelihood of success on the merits, the government focuses \nprimarily on questions of constitutional law, returning only grudgingly at the end of \n  13 \n\n \nits brief to remark on jurisdiction. But as the D.C. Circuit held, the jurisdictional \ninquiry is the central one\u2014and the government has failed to carry its heavy burden \nof demonstrating that this short-lived TRO is immediately appealable. Under these \ncircumstances, this Court is unlikely to review or reverse the D.C. Circuit\u2019s fact-\nbound, unpublished, and well-reasoned opinion dismissing for lack of jurisdiction. \nA.  Appellate Courts Presumptively Lack Jurisdiction to Review \nDistrict Court Decisions Granting or Denying TROs   \nSubject to limited exceptions, appellate courts may review only final judgments \nof district courts. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. Congress set forth one such exception in 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1), which creates appellate jurisdiction over \u201c[i]nterlocutory orders \nof the district courts . . . granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving \ninjunctions, or refusing to dissolve or modify injunctions.\u201d By virtue of this restriction \nto \u201cinjunctions,\u201d the \u201cgeneral rule is that orders granting, refusing, modifying, or \ndissolving  temporary  restraining  orders  are  not  appealable  under  \u00a7 1292(a)(1),\u201d \nwhereas orders granting or denying preliminary injunctions are appealable as of \nright, 16 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure \u00a7 3922.1 (3d ed.); Abbott v. \nPerez, 585 U.S. 579, 595 (2018). To be sure, a district court cannot \u201cshield\u201d an \ninjunction from appellate review merely by labelling it a temporary restraining order. \nSampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 87 (1974). But when an interim injunction is limited \nto the short timeframe permitted for TROs, does not conclusively resolve the issues, \nand does not pretermit future action for preliminary injunctive relief, there is a robust \npresumption against appealability. See, e.g., Almeida-Leon v. WM Cap. Mgmt., Inc., \nNo. 20-2089, 2024 WL 2904077, at *4-5 (1st Cir. June 10, 2024) (\u201cTo ensure an order \n  14 \n\n \nis  not  an  injunction  masquerading  as  a  TRO,  we  look  primarily  to  the  order\u2019s \nduration.  TROs  are  temporary  and  short;  injunctions  need  not  be.\u201d).  That  is \nparticularly true where a TRO merely preserves the status quo ante\u2014understood as \nthe  \u201clast  actual,  peaceable  uncontested  status  which  preceded  the  pending \ncontroversy.\u201d Mastrio v. Sebelius, 768 F.3d 116, 120 (2d Cir. 2014) (cleaned up). \nUnder those standards, the TRO entered here plainly qualifies as a true TRO \nrather than a de facto preliminary injunction. It simply preserves the status quo ante \nthat existed before the government\u2019s alleged unlawful conduct. It does not foreclose \nany further proceedings. It was issued in less than 48 hours and with highly limited \nbriefing and argument. And it lasts only for a very short duration\u2014consistent with \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b)\u2014while the district court engages in extremely \nexpedited proceedings to address the merits of the parties\u2019 underlying dispute.4 \nB.  The Government\u2019s Arguments for an Exception Lack Merit  \nThe government contends that this TRO should be treated as appealable for a \nreason that this Court has not previously recognized: because it allegedly intrudes \nupon the President\u2019s Article II powers. Of course, whether the President in fact enjoys \nan Article II prerogative to fire the Special Counsel without cause is the core merits \n \n4 This case is thus nothing like those cited by the government. See Mot. 31-32. In Brunner v. Ohio \nRepublican Party, 555 U.S. 5 (2008), the district court issued a TRO that operated as \u201ca litigation-\naltering and litigation-ending injunction because it [gave] the parties no \u2018meaningful appellate options\u2019 \nabout a significant issue of law given the imminence of an irreversible event [namely, the 2008 general \nelection].\u201d Ohio Republican Party v. Brunner, 544 F.3d 711, 715 (6th Cir.) (en banc), vacated, 555 U.S. \n5 (2008). The decision in Brewer v. Landrigan, 562 U.S. 996 (2010), similarly concerned an irreversible \nevent\u2014an  execution.  See  Landrigan  v.  Brewer,  625  F.3d  1144,  1145  n.1  (9th  Cir.  2010).  The \ngovernment\u2019s other authorities do not even involve temporary restraining orders. See Abbott, 585 U.S. \nat 579 (indefinite prohibition on the use of Texas\u2019s preferred maps qualified as an injunction); Carson \nv. Am. Brands, 450 U.S. 79, 84 (1981) (denial of a joint consent decree that \u201cwould have permanently \nenjoined respondents\u201d from discriminatory hiring practices was appealable).  \n  15 \n\n \nissue in this case. In that respect, the government seeks to collapse the jurisdictional \nand merits inquiries\u2014or, at minimum, to leverage its merits arguments into a basis \nfor exercising appellate jurisdiction over an otherwise unappealable order. The Court \nshould reject that maneuver, which would open the floodgates to many more fire-drill \nTRO appeals and which is particularly unjustified in the context of this litigation.  \n1. This lawsuit was first filed six days before the government\u2019s application for \nemergency relief in this Court. During that short period, the district court entered \ntwo orders, the D.C. Circuit decided two appeals, and this Court was asked (less than \n12 hours after the D.C. Circuit issued its second opinion at 11:06 PM on Saturday \nover a holiday weekend) to hurriedly pronounce on major issues of constitutional law. \nTo accept the government\u2019s position here would inevitably invite more of the same. \nThe government could not be clearer: its application cites a series of recent TROs and \nasks the Court to green light immediate appeals whenever such orders allegedly \nintrude on any of the President\u2019s broadly conceived Article II powers. Mot. 5 & n.1. \nAs the D.C. Circuit recognized, the government\u2019s position is a stark break from \nhistorical practice: \u201cWe see no reason to incentivize more requests for two-day rulings \nwhen the appeal of preliminary injunctions in the normal course has heretofore been \nadequate to protect the interests of litigants, including the government, in the vast \nmajority of cases.\u201d App. 41a. Moreover, endorsing that approach \u201cat a time when \nemergency litigation is becoming more prevalent\u201d would risk deluging federal courts \n(including this one) with emergency appeals \u201clitigated at a breakneck pace.\u201d Id.  \n  16 \n\n \nCases involving the separation of powers, and many other asserted Article II \ninterests, present greater (not lesser) reason for orderly judicial resolution. Such \nproceedings necessarily call upon courts to address the fundamental architecture of \nour constitutional system. Further, they often arise in politically fraught contexts. In \nthese disputes, care and deliberation are particularly important, and courts should \nbe wary of Executive Branch demands to bypass the procedural rules that exist to \nprotect sound judicial decisionmaking. The premature adjudication of issues touching \nupon the structural separation of powers\u2014especially when it occurs on an accelerated \ntimeframe, without full briefing and argument, and with an underdeveloped record\u2014\ncan provoke destabilizing, harmful consequences. And it may do so in cases where \nthis Court\u2019s intervention may not ultimately prove necessary in the normal course.5  \nThere are good reasons why this Court usually disfavors adjudicating cases in \nan emergency or interlocutory posture. See, e.g., Moyle v. United States, 603 U.S. 324, \n334  (2024)  (Barrett, J.,  concurring  in  the  dismissal  of  writs  of  certiorari  before \njudgment as improvidently granted); see also City of Tulsa v. Hooper, 143 S. Ct. 2556, \n2557 (2023) (statement of Kavanaugh, J., respecting denial of application for stay); \nDoes 1-3 v. Mills, 142 S. Ct. 17, 18 (2021) (Barrett, J., concurring in denial of \n \n5 For example, the government presumably will not seek certiorari if it convinces the district court in \njust over a week to deny a preliminary injunction and grant summary judgment in its favor. See, e.g., \nOp. & Order, Am. Fed\u2019n. of Govt\u2019 Emps., AFL-CIO v. Ezell, No. 25 Civ. 10276 (D. Mass. Feb 12, 2025), \nECF 66 (dissolving TRO and denying preliminary injunction to union plaintiffs who lacked standing \nto challenge OPM\u2019s \u201cFork in the Road\u201d directive). Or the President might reconsider his decision to \nterminate Special Counsel Dellinger, or the parties may arrive at some other consensual resolution. \nSee, e.g., Mem. for Heads of Exec. Dep\u2019ts & Agencies from Matthew J. Vaeth, Acting Dir., Off. of Mgmt. \n& Budget (Jan. 29, 2025) (rescinding OMB memorandum from two days prior instructing federal \nagencies to freeze federal funding). In these and potentially other respects, the issues presented here \nmay resolve without this Court\u2019s intervention. \n  17 \n\n \napplication for injunctive relief). Moreover, several Justices have noted reservations \nabout emergency requests to review \u201cadministrative stay\u201d orders\u2014which, much like \nthe TRO here, are \u201csupposed to be a short-lived prelude to the main event\u201d and a tool \nfor \u201cminimiz[ing] harm while the court deliberates.\u201d United States v. Texas, 144 S. \nCt. 797, 799 (2024) (Barrett, J., concurring in denial of applications to vacate stay). \nThose prudential and practical considerations also speak to this circumstance. \nThis proceeding reached the Supreme Court in less than six days, during which time \nthe arguments of the parties evolved significantly, the D.C. Circuit dismissed two \nappeals for lack of jurisdiction, and the district court entered a short TRO principally \nmeant to preserve the status quo ante while it reaches an expedited and appealable \ndisposition. Having raced here at breakneck speed, the government now asks the \nCourt to immediately address important constitutional questions with slight briefing \nand no argument, and to do so on grounds that would concededly open the floodgates \nto many more such \u201cemergency\u201d requests. The Court should reject that application\u2014\nand affirm that the Judiciary will continue to uphold jurisdictional rules that have \ngoverned constitutional cases for generations without imperiling Article II. \n2. The government\u2019s request for an exception to the presumptive rule against \nappealing TROs is particularly weak in this case. That is true for four main reasons.  \nFirst, the government materially misdescribes the TRO. In its application, the \ngovernment rests substantial parts of its case on the premise that the TRO applies to \nthe President. On that basis, it invokes precedents that relax jurisdictional and \nprocedural requirements due to solicitude for the Presidency. Mot. 32-33; but see App. \n  18 \n\n \n42a n.1 (noting the government\u2019s failure to raise these arguments below). But these \ncases are inapposite. Special Counsel Dellinger sought a declaratory judgment (not \ninjunctive relief) against the President. See Compl. at 13-14, No. 25 Civ. 385 (D.D.C. \nFeb. 10, 2025), ECF 1; Pl.\u2019s Mot. for TRO at 2, No. 25 Civ. 385, ECF 2. And the D.C. \nCircuit made clear that the TRO \u201cis properly read as not applying directly to the \nPresident but rather to the other defendants acting on his behalf.\u201d App. 42a n.1. This \ncase therefore does not \u201cinvolve[] the President\u201d in a manner similar to the cases cited \nby the government, where relief was sought or issued directly against a current or \nformer president. Mot. 32-33. Special Counsel Dellinger and the lower courts have \nproceeded with proper solicitude for the Presidency, and the TRO thus applies only \nto subordinate executive officials (as is customary in suits like this one), undercutting \nany assertion that personal presidential prerogatives are imperiled. \nSecond, the government concedes that it violated a clear, directly applicable, \nand longstanding statutory requirement when it fired Special Counsel Dellinger \nwithout cause. In light of that concession, it is difficult to comprehend how temporary \ncontinued adherence to the OSC\u2019s statutory scheme\u2014which has been upheld by \npresidents for half a century (and which was negotiated and expressly approved by \nPresident George H.W. Bush)\u2014constitutes a crisis for the separation of powers and \nan emergency that overrides limits on appellate jurisdiction. It is one thing for the \ngovernment to now dispute the continued constitutionality of the OSC\u2019s for-cause \nremoval  protection  in  light  of  recent  jurisprudence.  It  is  quite  another  for  the \ngovernment to willfully violate that provision, which no court has ever invalidated, \n  19 \n\n \nand to then declare that any judicial remedy (no matter how temporary) works such \nan extreme and irreparable harm to Article II that the Supreme Court must intervene \nwithin a matter of days. This is precisely the kind of circumstance in which the Court \nshould decline to review a TRO that briefly preserves the status quo ante while the \nJudiciary reviews the merits in an orderly, expedited, and deliberate fashion.  \nIndeed, the government fails to identify any other case in which this Court has \ngranted emergency relief to allow the government to continue violating a federal \nstatute that it was concededly violating. On its face, that is an improbable basis for \nthe exercise of emergency authority. And this would be a strange case in which to \ncreate that precedent. The district court and D.C. Circuit both preliminarily held that \nthe government\u2019s position on the merits is at least contestable as an extension of this \nCourt\u2019s authorities. See App. 46a; id. at 18a-19a. Therefore, they reasonably declined \nto \u201cpresume[] that the government is correct on the merits.\u201d Id. 41a. To grant the \ngovernment\u2019s application, in contrast, would require the Court to partially collapse \nthe constitutional merits inquiry into the threshold jurisdictional analysis\u2014thus \nsignificantly complicating an otherwise straightforward jurisdictional limitation and \ndeparting from precedent that ordinarily separates these two inquiries. See, e.g., \nLexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 128 n.4 (2014). \nTo take those steps in a case where the government wishes to continue violating an \nAct of Congress\u2014one whose constitutionality has not been reviewed by this Court\u2014\nwould mark an extraordinary and unwarranted new frontier in emergency relief.6 \n \n6 Nor is it reasonable for the government to blame Special Counsel Dellinger for somehow \u201ccreat[ing] \nthis emergency.\u201d Mot. 34. A White House staffer sent him a cursory email terminating him without \n  20 \n\n \nThird, the government asks the Court to take this leap in a case where the \nunderlying merits and its theory of irreparable injury are (at minimum) subject to \nserious dispute. We address these points in detail below. See infra at II.A, II.B.1. As \nwe demonstrate, there are very substantial reasons to doubt the government\u2019s claim \nthat  the  TRO  intruded  on  any  Article  II  prerogative  and,  in  any  event,  the \ngovernment fails to identify any concrete, immediate, irreversible consequences from \nthe TRO lasting eight more days. Whatever relief might be proper in a case where \nthe government could point to a clearly established and definite injury resulting from \na TRO, the open questions and abstract theories of harm it cites here come nowhere \nclose to justifying an extraordinary exemption from the ordinary jurisdictional bar.  \nFinally, the government fails to identify any basis to doubt the district court\u2019s \nable handling of the case, or to view its TRO as somehow improper. To the contrary, \nthe district court has proceeded with diligence and expedition. After Special Counsel \nDellinger filed his TRO application, it held a same-day hearing, granted a request by \ngovernment counsel to file an opposition the next day, and entered an interim order \nto preserve the status quo ante for three days. Two days later, it ruled on the TRO \npetition and set a preliminary injunction hearing for February 26, 2025. Over the \nfollowing days, it reaffirmed its commitment to \u201cextreme expedition,\u201d App. 32a, and \nset a quick briefing schedule that consolidated the preliminary injunction hearing \n \ncause\u2014in direct violation of a statutory for-cause removal protection\u2014late on a Friday night. Special \nCounsel Dellinger quickly asked the district court to preserve the status quo ante while the legality of \nthat termination was resolved. It was then the government that created this emergency (and several \nothers before it) through a series of emergency filings at odds with settled jurisdictional limitations. \nAnd it was the government that asked this Court to grant it emergency relief to violate a statute. \n  21 \n\n \nwith  summary  judgment  cross  motions  (thus  ensuring  an  appealable  final \nresolution), see Order, No. 25 Civ. 385 (D.D.C. Feb. 15, 2025, 4:27 PM). In fewer than \nnine days, the district court might well issue a final decision on the constitutional \nissues here. See App. 30a. As that summary of the proceedings makes clear, unlike in \nsome of the cases cited by the government, the district court presiding over this \nmatter is clearly acting with sincere efforts to render a timely and appropriately \nreasoned decision that respects the rights of all parties involved. There is thus no \nbasis in the district court proceedings to disturb the usual rule that TRO proceedings \ncannot be appealed; certainly, this TRO is not a \u201cstealth\u201d injunction. \nTogether, the considerations set forth above support the D.C. Circuit\u2019s narrow \nand carefully reasoned conclusion that it lacked appellate jurisdiction over this case \nat this juncture. This Court is unlikely to review or reverse that decision, and for that \nreason alone it should deny the government\u2019s unprecedented request for relief.  \nAs a fallback, the government refers to the All Writs Act. But absent a distinct \nsource of appellate jurisdiction, the Act does not support the government\u2019s position. \nSee Clinton v. Goldsmith, 526 U.S. 529, 534-35 (1999) (\u201c[T]he express terms of the \nAct confine the power of the [court] to issuing process \u2018in aid of\u2019 its existing statutory \njurisdiction; the Act does not enlarge that jurisdiction.\u201d); 33 Wright & Miller, Federal \nPractice & Procedure \u00a7 8313 (2d ed.) (\u201cAs the text of the All Writs Act indicates, it \ndoes not create an independent source of jurisdiction.\u201d).7 In passing, the government \n \n7 The cases cited by the government confirm as much. In U.S. Alkali Export Association v. United \nStates (which predated \u00a7 1292), this Court emphasized that because the All Writs Act \u201cmay not be \nused  as  a  substitute  for  an  authorized  appeal,\u201d  where  Congress  limits  \u201cappellate  review  of \ninterlocutory orders,\u201d an \u201cextraordinary writ is not permissible in the face of the plain indication of \n  22 \n\n \nalso  cites  mandamus,  but  does  not  urge  this  Court  to  exercise  any  mandamus \njurisdiction and offers no serious response to the D.C. Circuit\u2019s analysis of why it \n\u201cfails the Cheney test at every step.\u201d App. 47a. These abbreviated references to the \nAll Writs Act and mandamus thus fail to salvage the government\u2019s position. \nII.  Every Other Consideration Weighs Against Granting Relief \nEven if this Court were to review and reverse the D.C. Circuit\u2019s holding as to \nappellate jurisdiction, it should still reject the government\u2019s application for relief: the \ngovernment is not likely to prevail on the merits, has failed to establish irreparable \ninjury, and cannot show that the equities and relative harms weigh in its favor.  \nA.  The Government Is Not Likely to Prevail on the Merits \nSpecial  Counsel  Dellinger\u2019s  claims  rest  on  a  single  premise:  that  it  was \nunlawful to remove him from office without cause, in violation of his statutory for-\ncause removal protection. See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b). The government does not dispute \nthat it violated this statutory limitation. Instead, it advances two arguments: first, \nthat the for-cause removal provision is unconstitutional; and second, that even if the \nprovision is constitutional, the district court was powerless to order reinstatement in \nits TRO. The government is not substantially likely to prevail on either argument.  \n1. The government\u2019s lead submission is that \u00a7 1211(b) violates the separation \nof powers. As the district court and D.C. Circuit concluded, that contention fails to \n \nthe legislative purpose to avoid piecemeal reviews.\u201d 325 U.S. 196, 203 (1945); accord Pa. Bureau of \nCorr. v. U.S. Marshals Serv., 474 U.S. 34, 41 (1985) (\u201cIn United States Alkali, the Court rejected use \nof the all writs provision to enable the Court to review a lower court\u2019s determination where jurisdiction \ndid not lie under an express statutory provision.\u201d). Even less relevant is Coleman v. Paccar, Inc., where \nissuance of a writ to vacate a 60-day stay of a federal regulation by the circuit court was justified \nbecause that order was \u201cthe equivalent of a preliminary injunction.\u201d 424 U.S. 1301, 1303 (1976); see \nid. (\u201c[E]ven the full Court under \u00a7 1651 may issue writs only in aid of its jurisdiction.\u201d). \n  23 \n\n \ngrasp significant distinguishing features of the OSC. See App. 12a (\u201c[T]o date, the \nSupreme  Court  has  taken  pains  to  carve  the  OSC  out  of  its  pronouncements \nconcerning the President\u2019s broad authority to remove officials who assist him in \ndischarging his duties at will.\u201d); id. at 46a (\u201c[T]he cited cases do not hold that the \nPresident has unrestricted power to remove the Special Counsel.\u201d). The application \nof a for-cause removal rule to the OSC advances core statutory purposes, reflects a \nconsidered inter-branch agreement, and poses no harm to Article II prerogatives. \nThis  Court\u2019s  original  pronouncement  on  for-cause  removal  limits  is \nHumphrey\u2019s  Executor  v.  United  States,  which  upheld  the  constitutionality  of  a \nmaterially identical restriction on the President\u2019s authority to remove members of \nthe Federal Trade Commission. 295 U.S. 602, 625-26, 629 (1935). More broadly, the \nCourt recognized in Humphrey\u2019s Executor that Congress could shield agency heads \nfrom removal without cause where Congress deemed such protections necessary to \nsecure a modest measure of impartiality, expertise, and independence. As the Court \nis aware, that ruling continues to form the basis for an important part of the modern \nfederal government. E.g., Wiener v. United States, 357 U.S. 349, 355-56 (1958). \nIn recent years, this Court has invalidated removal limits for principal officers \nleading  single-headed  agencies  that  wield  binding  regulatory  and  enforcement \nauthority over private actors. As relevant, first came Seila Law LLC v. Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau, 591 U.S. 197 (2020). There, the Court noted that for-\ncause removal limits for single-person agency leadership structures are a relatively \nrecent phenomenon and warrant closer scrutiny. See id. at 220-22. It then concluded \n  24 \n\n \nthat applying such statutory protections to the Director of the CFPB, in particular, \nraised exceptionally grave concerns in light of the Director\u2019s power to \u201cissue final \nregulations, oversee adjudications, set enforcement priorities, initiate prosecutions, \nand determine what penalties to impose on private parties.\u201d Id. at 225. As the Court \nnoted, the Director\u2019s authority to \u201cdictate and enforce policy for a vital segment of the \neconomy affecting millions of Americans\u201d\u2014and to do so without accountability to the \nPresident through at-will removal\u2014infringed on Article II. Id. Accordingly, the Court \nheld that the President must be able to remove the CFPB Director at will. See id. at \n234-38. In reaching this conclusion, however, the Court expressly distinguished the \nOSC, which \u201cexercises only limited jurisdiction to enforce certain rules governing \nFederal Government employers and employees\u201d and \u201cdoes not bind private parties at \nall or wield regulatory authority comparable to the CFPB.\u201d Id. at 221. \nWhereas Seila Law distinguished removal protections at the OSC, it expressly \ncast into doubt such protections at the Federal Housing Finance Agency (\u201cFHFA\u201d)\u2014\nwhich were stricken down one year later in Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (2021). In \nreaching this conclusion, Collins reasoned that asserted differences between the \nCFPB and FHFA regarding the \u201cnature and breadth\u201d of their authority were not \ndispositive  of  the  constitutional  analysis\u2014adding  that  the  FHFA  was  in  some \nrespects  more  powerful  than  the  CFPB  and  that  it  had  direct  \u201cregulatory  and \nenforcement authority over two companies that dominate the secondary mortgage \nmarket and have the power to reshape the housing sector.\u201d Id. at 251, 253. \n  25 \n\n \nTaken together, Humphrey\u2019s Executor, Seila Law, and Collins all support the \nconstitutionality of the OSC\u2019s for-cause removal limitation. That is true for two \nindependent reasons: (a) the Special Counsel is an inferior rather than principal \nofficer (and those cases all concerned principal officers); and (b) the central reasons \ngiven for invalidating for-cause removal restrictions in those cases do not apply here. \na. It has long been settled that, for inferior officers, Congress can \u201climit and \nrestrict the power of removal as it deems best for the public interest.\u201d United States \nv. Perkins, 116 U.S. 483, 485 (1886); see also Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 161-\n64 (1926); Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 689 n.27 (1988). This Court recognized \nthat important distinction concerning inferior officers in Seila Law. See 591 U.S. at \n218-20 (discussing Morrison). In assessing whether a given official is an inferior or \nprincipal officer, the central question is \u201cwhether he has a superior other than the \nPresident.\u201d United States v. Arthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. 1, 13 (2021) (cleaned up). Courts \nalso consider the \u201cnature, scope, and duration of an officer\u2019s duties.\u201d Seila Law, 591 \nU.S. at 217 n.3 (citing Edmond v. United States, 520 U.S. 651, 661 (1997)). \nUnder that standard, the Special Counsel of the OSC in an inferior officer\u2014\nand Congress is thus freer to set terms for his removal from office. As explained above, \nthe Special Counsel\u2019s role is important but limited. In essence, he is an ombudsman. \nHe cannot regulate or penalize (directly or indirectly) any private conduct. Within the \nworld of federal employment, moreover, he cannot impose any discipline or adverse \naction on his own authority. Instead, he receives complaints and encourages agencies \nto seek consensual resolutions; in some cases, he may also petition the MSPB on an \n  26 \n\n \ninjured employee\u2019s behalf or petition it to address a possible Hatch Act violation, but \nit is then entirely up to the MSPB how it wishes to act on the petition. See AFGE, 747 \nF.2d at 753 (\u201c[T]he MSPB is free to disagree with the Special Counsel and often \ndoes.\u201d). The Special Counsel can issue subpoenas while investigating, but he cannot \nenforce them\u2014only the MSPB can do so. Similarly, although the Special Counsel can \nissue internal regulations and Hatch Act advisory opinions, they \u201cbind[] neither the \npublic nor any agency or officer of government.\u201d Id. at 752. The Special Counsel \ncannot bring an action in federal court. Nor can he conduct his own investigation of \nreports from employee-whistleblowers within agencies; for such cases, his role is \nlimited to reviewing and assessing any investigations by the relevant agency.  \nIn these ways, the Special Counsel is effectively supervised by and accountable \nto the MSPB and the other agencies where whistleblowers raise concerns: they must \nexercise their independent discretion in assessing whether to uphold or pursue his \npositions. The Special Counsel does not engage in \u201cprosecutorial decisionmaking\u201d in \nany standard sense, Mot. 2, and it is quite an overstatement to compare his HR-\noriented administrative function to the criminal enforcement power wielded by U.S. \nAttorneys, Mot. 15.8 Similarly, the Special Counsel\u2019s powers do not resemble the \nauthority of the principal officers who lead the CFPB and FHFA. The CFPB Director, \nfor  instance,  wields  the  power  to  \u201cunilaterally  issue  final  regulations,  oversee \nadjudications, set enforcement priorities, initiate prosecutions, and determine what \n \n8 For instance, federal prosecutors face checks and balances from Article III courts, whereas the Special \nCounsel\u2019s authorities (except for his reporting duties) are all checked and balanced within Article II. \nAdditionally, federal prosecutors hold power to bind and make representations on behalf of the United \nStates. The Special Counsel lacks power to bind anyone. \n  27 \n\n \npenalties to impose on private parties.\u201d Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 225. The FHFA \nDirector, in turn, can \u201chold hearings,\u201d \u201csuspend corporate officers,\u201d \u201cbring civil actions \nin federal court,\u201d and \u201cimpose penalties ranging from $2,000 to $2 million per day.\u201d \nCollins, 594 U.S. at 230. The Special Counsel possesses no such executive powers. \nAccordingly, the Special Counsel is properly considered an inferior officer \nunder this Court\u2019s precedent\u2014and the for-cause removal provision is thus lawful.  \nb. Alternatively, the government has failed to establish a likelihood of success \non the merits because the OSC is distinguishable from the CFPB and FHFA in ways \nthat powerfully support the continued constitutionality of its removal limitation. \nFirst, Seila Law and Collins were animated by a profound concern about the \nPresident\u2019s  inability  to  remove  officials  sitting  atop  single-headed  agencies  that \nexercise core executive power in ways that could \u201cdictate and enforce policy for a vital \nsegment of the economy affecting millions of Americans.\u201d Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 225; \naccord Collins, 594 U.S. at 255. As the Court appropriately recognized when it \ndistinguished the OSC in Seila Law, however, that concern is not present here.  \nFundamentally, the OSC is an investigative agency with limited advisory and \nreporting functions\u2014all of which are focused on HR issues. In performing these \nfunctions, the OSC does not regulate or penalize private activity. See Seila Law, 591 \nU.S. at 221 (noting that the OSC \u201cdoes not bind private parties at all\u201d). The OSC also \nlacks  the  power  to  issue  binding  regulations,  oversee  adjudications,  commence \nprosecutions, determine what penalties to impose, appear in an Article III tribunal \n(except as an amicus), or control in any way the substantive regulatory framework \n  28 \n\n \nfor any public or private entities. In these essential respects, none of the OSC\u2019s \nauthorities comes close to the exercise of \u201csubstantial executive power.\u201d Mot. 17 n.5. \nConsistent with those statutory limitations, the OSC\u2019s authority to \u201cpromulgate \nregulations,\u201d Mot. 6, 28, is strictly confined to nonbinding advisory opinions and \ninternal OSC affairs, see AFGE, 747 F.2d at 752 (observing that such regulations \n\u201cbind[] neither the public nor any agency or officer of government\u201d). And only the \nMSPB,  rather  than  the  OSC,  can  \u201cissue[]  .  .  .  decisions  in  administrative \nadjudications.\u201d Mot. 17 n.5. While the OSC\u2019s work is essential, it occurs within a \n\u201climited jurisdiction\u201d related to federal employers and employees. Seila Law, 591 U.S. \nat 221. It poses no \u201cspecial threat to individual liberty\u201d for the Special Counsel to \nreceive limited independence from political control in reviewing and investigating \nconfidential whistleblower reports from federal employees. Id. at 223. \nSecond, consistent with the reasoning of Humphrey\u2019s Executor, the OSC exists \nto vindicate functions and interests held in common by Congress, the Executive \nBranch, and the public. Congress carefully designed the OSC to play an important \nreporting role with respect to legislative oversight and deliberations. See 5 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1217. The OSC\u2019s work also furthers the distinct and shared inter-branch interest in \npromoting Executive Branch compliance with congressionally imposed ethical and \npersonnel requirements. In that respect, the OSC is more than just an aspect of the \nexecutive power or extension of presidential will. See Humphrey\u2019s Executor, 295 U.S. \nat 628. Moreover, the OSC\u2019s structure\u2014including its for-cause removal provision\u2014\nreflects a heavily negotiated inter-branch resolution that was embraced by President \n  29 \n\n \nBush when he signed the Whistleblower Protection Act (and by his Attorney General \nin cooperating to pass the bill). In fact, not one, but two Presidents\u2014Carter and \nBush\u2014signed legislation with for-cause removal protections at the OSC, making \nclear that any interstitial concerns raised by their subordinates at the OLC had either \nbeen addressed or overruled in practice by the Office of the President.9 \nFinally, the need for independence at the OSC is unique in its character and \npurposes. With respect to the CFPB and FHFA, the case for agency independence \nrested heavily on a substantive belief that economic regulation should be free of \nspecific forms of presidential political control. See Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 207; Collins, \n594 U.S. at 229-30. Agency independence in those settings was specifically designed \nto restrain the President\u2019s ability to direct the agencies\u2019 regulatory powers consistent \nwith his agenda. Here, in contrast, the OSC lacks any regulatory powers\u2014and the \nindependence  afforded  by  its  statutory  for-cause  removal  provisions  serves  an \nentirely  different  function.  Rather  than  hamper  the  President\u2019s  substantive \nregulatory agenda, the OSC\u2019s independence protects and assures whistleblowers. If \nthe  official  charged with  protecting whistleblowers  from  retaliation  was  himself \nutterly vulnerable to retaliation and removal for taking on politically charged or \ninconvenient cases, then the OSC\u2019s whistleblower protection purpose might fail when \nit  is  most  needed.  Simply  put,  Congress  reasonably  found\u2014and  two  Presidents \nagreed\u2014that  the  Special  Counsel  cannot  serve  as  an  independent  watchdog,  or \n \n9 It is surprising to see the government invoke concepts rooted in the unitary executive theory while \ntreating OLC opinions from the 1970s as more authoritative than President Bush\u2019s own statement \nconcerning the for-cause removal language in the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989.  \n  30 \n\n \nprotect whistleblowers, if he is subject at all times to removal without cause. See, e.g., \nConstitutionality of the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s Tenure Protection, 2021 WL \n2981542, at *6 n.3, *9 (O.L.C. July 8, 2021) (concluding that Collins rendered the \nSocial Security Commissioner removable at-will but did not necessarily apply to the \nOSC by virtue of its \u201cprimarily investigatory function\u201d and \u201climited jurisdiction\u201d).  \nFor these reasons, the government has not shown a substantial likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits of its position that the OSC\u2019s for-cause removal protection is \nunconstitutional. At minimum, this remains an open question of constitutional law \nand is not properly resolved in an emergency appeal from a TRO. See App. 46a. \n 2. The government separately argues that it is likely to prevail on the theory \nthat courts lack the power in equity (and otherwise) to issue reinstatement remedies \nto unlawfully removed officials. Mot. 21-25. Much of this argument is focused solely \non the reinstatement of principal officers and is distinguishable on the basis that the \nSpecial Counsel is an inferior officer. See supra at 26-28. More troubling, having \nbarely developed this argument below, the government now seeks to raise complex \nissues with little recent instructive precedent to guide the inquiry (and no on-point \nreasoning from either the district court or D.C. Circuit here). These tactics counsel \nagainst making major pronouncements on the law of remedies\u2014or resting decisions \non such hastily developed points\u2014in an emergency appeal from a TRO. \nIn any event, the government\u2019s argument is flawed in several respects. To \nstart, Special Counsel Dellinger did not seek, and the district court did not direct in \nits  TRO,  \u201creinstatement\u201d  to  the  office  of  Special  Counsel.  Rather,  he  sought  a \n  31 \n\n \ndeclaration that his termination was unlawful (and therefore void ab initio), as well \nas injunctive relief, and the district court issued a TRO providing that he \u201cshall \ncontinue to serve as the Special Counsel.\u201d App. 29a (emphasis added). As explained \nabove, that relief does not run directly to the President but instead to \u201csubordinate \nexecutive officials\u201d who may \u201cde facto\u201d provide Special Counsel Dellinger with the \nprivileges and authorities of his office. Severino v. Biden, 71 F.4th 1038, 1042-43 (D.C. \nCir.  2023);  see  also,  e.g.,  Swan  v.  Clinton,  100  F.3d  973,  989  (D.C.  Cir.  1996) \n(Silberman, J., concurring). Whatever the general rule as to reinstatement, this TRO \npreserved rather than reinstated the Special Counsel\u2019s ongoing tenure in office. \nNor is the government right to assert that reinstatement to office is prohibited \nas a judicial remedy. Mot. 23. For example, courts have long recognized proceedings \nin quo warranto as \u201ca plain, speedy, and adequate\u201d remedy in law \u201cfor trying the title \nto office.\u201d Delgado v. Chavez, 140 U.S. 586, 590 (1891); see also, e.g., Newman v. U.S. \nex rel. Frizzell, 238 U.S. 537, 544 (1915) (\u201cThe writ thus came to be used as a means \nof determining which of two claimants was entitled to an office . . . .\u201d). This procedure \nvests courts with the traditional remedial authority \u201cnot only to oust the respondent \n[officer] but also to install the relator [officer].\u201d Floyd R. Mechem, A Treatise on the \nLaw of Public Offices and Officers \u00a7 496 (1890); e.g., Boyd v. Nebraska, 143 U.S. 135, \n151 (1892); U.S. ex rel. Crawford v. Addison, 73 U.S. 291, 297 (1867) (observing that \nupon judgment of ouster, \u201crelator thereupon became entitled to the office\u201d). \n \n  32 \n\n \nIn fact, the government\u2019s lead case (which declined to enjoin a state proceeding) \nsays as much in portions that the government omits: \u201cThe jurisdiction to determine \nthe title to a public office belongs exclusively to the courts of law, and is exercised \neither by . . . mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto, or information in the nature of \na writ of quo warranto, according to . . . the mode of procedure, established by the \ncommon law or by statute.\u201d In re Sawyer, 124 U.S. 200, 212 (1888); see also id. at 213, \n216, 220 (same). The government\u2019s other authorities say the same, or rested on the \nvery distinct point (also at issue in Sawyer) that federal courts should abstain from \nadjudicating state offices. See, e.g., Walton v. House of Representatives of State of Okl., \n265 U.S. 487, 490 (1924) (eligibility of state representative); Harkrader v. Wadley, \n172 U.S. 148, 165 (1898) (declining to enjoin state criminal proceeding). As a matter \nof first principles, there is no reason that reinstatement is not available to an officer \nremoved by the President in violation of for-cause removal protections. See Laurence \nH. Tribe, American Constitutional Law 250 n.20 (2d ed. 1988). \nTo be sure, the government attempts to derive a \u201cbackpay-only\u201d rule from a \nhandful of prior cases involving removed officers. But this overlooks a key point: a \nlitigant\u2019s choices about what remedy to seek may reflect practical considerations \nrather than a legal prohibition. For instance, Myron Wiener originally did sue for \nreinstatement, but the War Claims Commission from which he was removed was \nabolished by Congress while his suit was pending, and he subsequently refiled to seek \nonly backpay. See Wiener, 357 U.S. at 350. As for Messrs. Myers and Humphrey, \nneither petitioned the Court for reinstatement because both had died over a year \n  33 \n\n \nbefore their cases were decided\u2014which made reinstatement awfully unlikely, but \ncertainty did not prove the unavailability of reinstatement remedies. See Humphrey\u2019s \nExecutor, 295 U.S. at 612; Myers, 272 U.S. at 52 (suit by \u201cadministratrix\u201d).10  \nRegardless, the district court here did not issue its relief in a vacuum, but \nrather by reference to a statutory provision that seeks to achieve important purposes \nin securing a measure of agency independence from direct political control. It is \nappropriate to describe equitable remedies by reference to that statutory scheme. See \nCIGNA Corp. v. Amara, 563 U.S. 421, 444-45 (2011); Porter v. Warner Holding Co., \n328 U.S. 395, 398 (1946); Hecht Co. v. Bowles, 321 U.S. 321, 330-31 (1944). In creating \nfor-cause  removal  protections,  Congress  fundamentally  undertook  to  safeguard \ncovered officials against removal without cause. It follows from this core statutory \ndesign that officials removed without cause can, in the first instance, seek a judicial \norder (just like the one issued here) providing for their continuance in office. \nTo hold otherwise would reduce for-cause removal protections to rubble\u2014\nwhich is now the government\u2019s publicly stated goal, see Mot. 17 n.5, but which it \nwould be mightily strange to endorse through a procedurally improper TRO appeal. \nOn the government\u2019s view, a President could fire independent agency officials at will \nand, at most, months or years later, after final judgment and appeal, those fired \nofficials might be able to recover some backpay from the Treasury . . . but nothing \nmore. On this logic, a century of ink and energy devoted to agency independence has \n \n10 This may not come as a surprise to the government, which apparently deleted \u201cthe deceased\u201d from \nits description of Humphrey\u2019s Executor in its brief. See Mot. 22 (describing Humphrey\u2019s Executor as a \n\u201csuit \u2018to recover a sum of money alleged to be due * * * for salary,\u201d where \u201c* * *\u201d replaces \u201cthe deceased\u201d). \n  34 \n\n \nbeen a colossal misadventure: all it would cost is a few thousand dollars from the U.S. \nTreasury for a President to buy his way out of for-cause removal restrictions. Rather \nthan infer that so many presidents, legislators, courts, scholars, and agency officials \nmisunderstood how for-cause removal restrictions work\u2014namely, to keep covered \nofficials in office unless they are properly terminated with cause\u2014the far more \nnatural inference is that equity permits courts to afford continuance or reinstatement \nremedies as necessary to effectuate these longstanding statutory safeguards. \nFor these reasons, the government is not likely to succeed on the merits of this \nargument. At minimum, in light of the government\u2019s failure to develop this point \nbelow\u2014and given the absence of any reasoning on these issues from either lower \ncourt or from any recent opinion of this Court\u2014the government has not carried its \nheavy burden of demonstrating entitlement to emergency relief on this ground.11 \nB.  The Remaining Equitable Factors Cut Against Relief  \nFinally, the government\u2019s application should be denied because it cannot show \nthat it would be irreparably harmed by the denial of a stay or that the balance of the \nequities (including the relative harms to the parties) supports its request for relief.  \n1. The D.C. Circuit held that the government failed to demonstrate the kind of \nconcrete, here-and-now, and irreparable harm that would support emergency relief. \nApp.  47a.  In  this  Court,  the  government  seeks  to  show  otherwise  by  citing \n\u201ctransparently irreparable\u201d harm \u201cto the Executive Branch, to the separation of \n \n11 The government asserts that the TRO prevents the President from terminating Special Counsel \nDellinger for cause without going to the district court first. Mot. 21. The government did not raise this \nconcern to either court below. If it wishes to do so, the appropriate place to start is the district court.  \n  35 \n\n \npowers, and to our democratic system.\u201d Mot. 26. This claim, like the government\u2019s \njurisdictional arguments, confuses the merits with irreparable harm. In any event, it \nis unconvincing: these asserted democratic and constitutional interests will not be \nirreparably harmed by a short, time-limited order; rather it is only \u201cthe resolution of \nthe case on the merits, not whether the [order] is stayed pending appeal, that will \naffect those principles.\u201d Texas v. United States, 787 F.3d 733, 767-68 (5th Cir. 2015). \nIndeed, the government frequently asserts analogous interests while seeking \nstays\u2014but even when it has cited \u201ccore\u201d executive interests, including interests in \ncontrolling criminal and immigration enforcement practices, courts have repeatedly \ndeclined to stay orders, finding that they do not inflict irreparable harm. See, e.g., id. \nat 767-69 (denying stay of order that affirmatively required the enforcement of \nfederal immigration laws); State v. Biden, 10 F.4th 538, 558-60 (5th Cir. 2021) \n(denying stay pending appeal in similar circumstances); E. Bay Sanctuary Covenant \nv. Trump, 932 F.3d 742, 778 (9th Cir. 2018) (denying stay of order that precluded the \nenforcement of immigration entry requirements); Washington v. Trump, 847 F.3d \n1151, 1168 (9th Cir. 2017) (per curiam) (denying stay of TRO that temporarily blocked \nan executive order restricting entry by certain foreign nationals); accord App. 3a \n(Katsas, J., concurring) (finding it unclear if \u201cserious but abstract separation-of-\npowers  concerns  .  .  .  amount  to  the  kind  of  concrete,  immediate,  irreversible \nconsequences that would warrant treating . . . a TRO as a preliminary injunction\u201d).12 \n \n12 The government separately asserts a harm to democracy itself because the district court\u2019s order \nkeeps in the office of the Special Counsel \u201ca person who answers to no one and for whom no one voted.\u201d \nMot. 28-29. But as set forth above, the Special Counsel answers to the MSPB and to other agency \nofficials, wields no regulatory power over any private citizen, and cannot directly take adverse action \n  36 \n\n \nThe government further claims that the TRO has deprived the President of the \nability to \u201cimplement his agenda through a principal officer of his choosing.\u201d Mot. 27. \nBut even if the Special Counsel were a principal officer (which he is not), nowhere in \nits brief does the government identify any action or inaction that Special Counsel \nDellinger has taken that would result in irreparable harm to the President\u2019s agenda. \nAnd given the President\u2019s obligations under the Take Care Clause, it is not apparent \nthat the government could show irreparable harm from any lawful action by Special \nCounsel  Dellinger  to  promote  compliance  with  statutory  protections  for  federal \nemployees. Nor does the government reconcile its broad assertions of harm with the \nlimited authorities exercised by the OSC, which (as explained above) include the \nreceipt of complaints by federal employees, investigations of the same (or reviews of \ninvestigations by other agencies), reports to Congress and the President, and filing \ncomplaints at the MSPB. See supra at 7-9. While the government objects that the \nPresident should be allowed to fire the Special Counsel for any reason or none at all, \nMot. 27, here it seeks to stay a TRO and must therefore show irreparable injury\u2014\nand yet it continues to fail to identify any irreparable, substantial harm.  \nFinally, the government claims an irreparable harm to the OSC because of the \nrisk that the Special Counsel\u2019s actions will be \u201cexposed . . . to legal challenge.\u201d Mot. \n30. But Special Counsel Dellinger\u2014as the presidentially nominated and Senate-\n \neven within the sphere of federal employment. So the government\u2019s concern has little substance. And \nthe government ignores entirely the significant democratic interest in complying with a 50-year-old \nstatute implemented by the people\u2019s representatives in Congress, signed by two Presidents elected by \nthe people, which responded to public concern that public-minded whistleblowers in the federal civil \nservice required independent protection from potential political reprisal. See supra at 4-6.  \n  37 \n\n \nconfirmed leader of the agency\u2014is by far the most legally secure leader of the OSC. \nAnd any confusion concerning his authority is due principally to the government \nitself, which removed him without cause (in direct violation of an applicable statute) \nand then purported to name another Acting Special Counsel even after the district \ncourt had granted interim relief in this case. See App. 22a n.5, 31a. It is in everybody\u2019s \ninterest to clarify the leadership of the OSC. But the government is holding a big \nstone in a tiny glass house if it believes that Mr. Dellinger is responsible for any \nuncertainty over the lawful leadership of this whistleblower-protection agency.  \nThe government has had ample and repeated opportunity to identify concrete \nand irreparable harm from the TRO that maintains Special Counsel Dellinger in his \noffice. Nevertheless, it continues to offer only abstract and non-specific interests, and \nfails to show how they are irreparable or to distinguish cases denying relief on similar \ngrounds. For this independent reason, the government\u2019s application should be denied. \n2. In its balancing of the equities, the government insists that Special Counsel \nDellinger suffered no injury when he was unlawfully terminated\u2014and that he thus \nhas no personal stake or equity in the outcome of this proceeding. Mot. 30-31. As the \ndistrict court explained at length, with hardly any response from the government, \nthat counterintuitive position is mistaken. See App. 19a-27a. Simply put, Special \nCounsel Dellinger suffered well-recognized, cognizable harm from the government\u2019s \nunlawful conduct\u2014and (by virtue of this suit in his official capacity) is also a proper \nparty to assert the substantial institutional equities of the OSC itself in preserving \nthe independence necessary to its confidential whistleblower protection function. \n  38 \n\n \nThose interests, as well as the public interest, further support maintaining the \nTRO\u2014which, again, is set to expire on February 26\u2014while the legal issues in this \ncase are resolved in an appropriately deliberative and orderly fashion. Otherwise, \nthere may be continued whiplash at the OSC as courts assess the legality of its for-\ncause removal protection (and the purported removal of Special Counsel Dellinger). \nOf course, this would be an especially unfortunate moment at which to weaken the \nOSC, given the historic upheaval currently occurring within federal employment and \nthe continued importance of ensuring that whistleblowers are guarded from reprisal.  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  39 \n\n \nCONCLUSION \n For the reasons set forth above, the government\u2019s application to vacate the \nTRO and alternative request for an immediate administrative stay should be denied. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n  /s/ Joshua A.

Re-\nspondent agrees that at least some temporary restraining orders can be immediately \nappealed, and that this Court has previously vacated TROs.  See Opp. 14-15 & n.4.  \nSo reviewing this TRO would not open new jurisdictional floodgates.   \nIndeed, respondent (Opp. 2) acknowledges the \u201cspecial solicitude\u201d that courts \nhave accorded the President in hearing immediate appeals from decisions affecting \ncore executive prerogatives.  And this TRO functions like a preliminary injunction\u2014\nthe hallmark of appealability even for TROs involving private parties\u2014and is inde-\npendently mandamus-worthy.  The TRO allows the district court, not the President, \nto decide who should run an agency that exercises prosecutorial and investigative \npowers.  The TRO thus stops the President from shaping the agenda of an executive-\nbranch agency in the new administration\u2019s critical first days.  Even if the court of \n(1) \n\n2 \nappeals were later to reverse a subsequent preliminary injunction, the damage to the \nPresidency and the separation of powers would be irreversible and irremediable.  \nRespondent treats immediate judicial review as a problem, not a safeguard.  \nBut by cramping this Court\u2019s jurisdiction, respondent\u2019s position would invite inter-\nbranch trench warfare whenever a new administration takes office.  District judges \ncould issue TROs barring all removals of agency-head holdovers from a prior admin-\nistration, no matter how clear-cut the President\u2019s removal authority.  TROs could \nprohibit presidential pardons from taking effect, bar recognition of foreign sovereigns, \nor stop military action.  Yet, on respondent\u2019s telling, so long as district courts preserve \nthe pre-inauguration status quo ante and limit TROs to the 28-day timeframe pre-\nscribed by Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b), neither this Court nor any other \nappellate court can do anything about it.   \nRespondent invokes the specter of a flood of applications to this Court.  But \nTROs have always been appealable in certain circumstances and grants or denials of \nmandamus are always reviewable, yet no flood of appeals has transpired.  The deluge \ninstead comes from district courts, which in the last few weeks alone have halted \ndozens of presidential actions (or even perceived actions).  Just yesterday, a district \njudge issued a TRO forcing the reinstatement of a member of the Merit Systems Pro-\ntection Board whom the President removed, preventing her removal until at least \nMarch 3.  D. Ct. Doc. 9, Harris v. Bessent, No. 25-cv-412 (D.D.C. Feb. 18, 2025).  This \nCourt should make clear that immediate appellate review remains available to check \nTROs that usurp core Article II powers.  TROs are not blank checks for district courts \nto stop any and all presidential actions for up to a month at a time. \nA.  This Court Has Jurisdiction To Vacate The District Court\u2019s TRO \nRespondent principally contends (Opp. 1) that the district court\u2019s order \u201ccannot \n \n\n3 \nbe appealed.\u201d  That contention misapprehends multiple jurisdictional rules.  This \nCourt has both the authority to review this TRO and ample means to prevent re-\nspondent\u2019s hypothetical parade of TRO appeals.   \n1.  Respondent focuses (Opp. 14-15) on the court of appeals\u2019 jurisdiction to \nreview the district court\u2019s TRO.  But what matters is this Court\u2019s jurisdiction.  Re-\nspondent concedes (id. at 15 n.4) that this Court has previously reviewed and vacated \nTROs issued by district courts.  See Brewer v. Landrigan, 562 U.S. 996 (2010); Brun-\nner v. Ohio, 555 U.S. 5 (2008) (per curiam).  There is no bright-line bar to review.  \nRespondent errs in arguing (Opp. 22-23) that this Court may vacate a TRO \nunder the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. 1651, only if the court of appeals would have juris-\ndiction to review the TRO.  The Court has held that the Act grants it \u201cfull power in \nits discretion to issue [a] writ\u201d directly \u201cto a federal District Court.\u201d  Ex parte Peru, \n318 U.S. 578, 584-585 (1943); see, e.g., id. at 586-587 (invoking the  Act to directly \nreview a district court\u2019s interlocutory order denying a foreign state\u2019s sovereign-im-\nmunity defense); Ex parte United States, 287 U.S. 241, 248-249 (1932) (invoking the \nAct to review a district court\u2019s interlocutory order denying the government\u2019s petition \nfor a bench warrant).   \nOf course, the All Writs Act does not independently grant jurisdiction, instead \nempowering courts to issue writs \u201cin aid of their respective jurisdictions.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n1651; Opp. 22-23.  But this Court and others can still issue appropriate orders in aid \nof future jurisdiction over an appeal from a final decision.  See Roche v. Evaporated \nMilk Ass\u2019n, 319 U.S. 21, 25 (1943) (writ issued by court of appeals before district \ncourt\u2019s entry of final judgment); FTC v. Dean Foods Co., 384 U.S. 597, 603-605 (1966) \n(order issued by court of appeals before final agency action).  The district court\u2019s final \norder in this case will be reviewable in the court of appeals, then in this Court.  Just \n \n\n4 \nas this Court may grant stays of preliminary injunctions or other threshold relief, \nthis Court may grant relief now \u201c\u200a\u2018in aid of this Court\u2019s jurisdiction\u2019 to review by cer-\ntiorari a final disposition on the merits.\u201d  Coleman v. Paccar, Inc., 424 U.S. 1301, 1303 \n(1976) (Rehnquist, J., in chambers) (citation omitted).   \n2.  Even if this Court\u2019s jurisdiction depended on the lower court\u2019s jurisdic-\ntion, the D.C. Circuit had jurisdiction to review the TRO here.  Respondent concedes \nthat courts of appeals may review at least some TROs and that \u201ca district court cannot \n\u2018shield\u2019 an injunction from appellate review merely by labelling it a temporary re-\nstraining order.\u201d  Opp. 14 (citation omitted).  The only question is whether \u201cthis \nTRO\u2014which orders the President to recognize the authority of an agency head whom \nhe has formally removed\u2014qualifies for immediate review.\u201d  Appl. App. 50a (Katsas, \nJ., dissenting).  The answer is yes.   \nThis Court has held that an order is properly regarded as an appealable in-\njunction if it has \u201c\u200a\u2018serious, perhaps irreparable consequences\u2019 that [a party] can \u2018ef-\nfectually challenge\u2019 only by an immediate appeal.\u201d  Carson v. American Brands, Inc., \n450 U.S. 79, 90 (1981).  This Court has further recognized that, in determining ap-\npealability, courts of appeals owe \u201cspecial solicitude\u201d \u201cto claims alleging a threatened \nbreach of essential Presidential prerogatives under the separation of powers.\u201d  Nixon \nv. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731, 743 (1982).  Under those precedents, the Executive \nBranch must be able to appeal orders that \u201cenjoin the President in the performance \nof his official duties,\u201d Mississippi v. Johnson, 4 Wall. 475, 501 (1866), or that restrain \nthe exercise of his \u201cconclusive and preclusive\u201d Article II powers, Trump v. United \nStates, 603 U.S. 593, 607 (2024) (citation omitted).  Thus, a TRO may be appealable \nwhen it \u201cdeeply intrude[s] into the core concerns of the executive branch,\u201d OPM v. \nAmerican Federation of Government Employees, 473 U.S. 1301, 1305 (1985) (Burger, \n \n\n5 \nC.J., in chambers) (citation omitted), as this one manifestly does.  \nHistorically, TROs that transgress those constitutional principles have been \nrare.  But when they occur, their appealability is essential to preserving the consti-\ntutional structure.  The separation of powers requires that \u201ceach department\u201d have \nthe \u201cconstitutional means\u201d \u201cto resist encroachments of the others.\u201d  The Federalist \nNo. 51, at 349 (Jacob E. Cooke ed., 1961) (James Madison).  The President can resist \ncongressional encroachments by vetoing bills and declining to enforce unconstitu-\ntional statutes.  But his defense against judicial encroachments is to appeal.  If the \nappellate courts refuse to hear such appeals, district courts could whittle away Article \nII\u2019s vision of \u201can independent Executive\u201d for a up to a month without any practical \ncheck.  See Trump, 603 U.S. at 613 (citation omitted).  The Framers envisioned an \nExecutive Branch that would pursue \u201cenergetic, vigorous, decisive, and speedy exe-\ncution of the laws\u201d and \u201cdeemed an energetic executive essential to \u2018the protection of \nthe community against foreign attacks,\u2019 \u2018the steady administration of the laws, \u2018the \nprotection of property,\u2019 and \u2018the security of liberty.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 610 (citation omitted).  \nThey certainly did not envision that district courts could replace energy with manda-\ntory delay and stop the President from fulfilling his constitutional responsibilities \nduring month-long stretches so long as they label their orders TROs.     \nAs an independent basis for jurisdiction, the court of appeals or this Court can \nreview the TRO through mandamus, as respondent concedes (Opp. 23).  This case \nclears the high bar for that relief, especially given the separation-of-powers context.  \n\u201cAccepted mandamus standards are broad enough to allow a court of appeals to pre-\nvent a lower court from interfering with a coequal branch\u2019s ability to discharge its \nconstitutional responsibilities.\u201d  Cheney v. United States District Court, 542 U.S. 367, \n382 (2004); see Appl. 33.  \n \n\n6 \n3.  Respondent instead views (Opp. 1, 17) immediate judicial review as the \ngreater threat to the republic.  In respondent\u2019s view, permitting appeals of TROs like \nthis one would promote \u201chigh-stakes emergency litigation,\u201d undermine \u201corderly ad-\nministration  and  sound  deliberation,\u201d  cause  \u201cpremature  escalation  of  politically \nfraught disputes,\u201d and force courts to act \u201con an accelerated timeframe, without full \nbriefing and argument.\u201d  But it is respondent who insisted that this case warranted \nfive-alarm relief.  He sought a TRO the same day he filed suit on the ground that this \ncase was \u201curgent,\u201d D. Ct. Doc. 2-1, at 1 (Feb. 10, 2025), and that he needed immediate \nrelief lest he be deprived of his office \u201cfor weeks,\u201d 2/10/25 D. Ct. Tr. 16.  The district \ncourt obliged, first by granting him an \u201cadministrative stay\u201d within hours after he \nsued (before the government had even a chance to respond), and then by granting the \nTRO at issue.  See Appl. 8-9.   \nHaving gotten a President-stopping TRO in record time, respondent can hardly \ncomplain about the pace of ensuing proceedings.  If respondent wanted orderly deci-\nsion-making, he had only to wait for the district court to issue final judgment on his \nclaim for back pay, as other removed officers have done throughout American history.  \nSee Appl. 22.  Or he could have awaited a ruling on a motion for a preliminary in-\njunction.  Having proclaimed an emergency to get a precedent-breaking TRO, re-\nspondent is in no position to insist that this Court await \u201csound deliberation\u201d before \naddressing \u201ccomplex questions of constitutional law.\u201d  Opp. 1.  This Court should ac-\ncord at least as much solicitude to the elected President\u2019s interest in managing the \nExecutive Branch as the district court (wrongly) accorded to a fired Special Counsel\u2019s \ninterest in continuing to run an executive agency.   \nRespondent emphasizes (Opp. 19) that a \u201cdirectly applicable\u201d statute provides \nthat the President may remove the Special Counsel only for cause.  But brandishing \n \n\n7 \na statute does not make the merits close when that statute is manifestly unconstitu-\ntional under this Court\u2019s precedents.  See pp. 9-13, infra.  And the Court need not \neven reach those merits to vacate the TRO, which violates this Court\u2019s repeated hold-\nings that courts of equity may not \u201crestrain an executive officer from making a wrong-\nful removal.\u201d  White v. Berry, 171 U.S. 366, 377 (1898); see Appl. 23-24.   \nRespondent warns (Opp. 16) that granting relief here would \u201copen the flood-\ngates to many more fire-drill TRO appeals.\u201d  But this case is easy to cabin in two \nrespects.  First, the district court issued an order that runs against the President.  \nSee p. 13, infra.  The President \u201coccupies a unique position in the constitutional \nscheme\u201d as \u201cthe only person who alone composes a branch of government.\u201d  Trump, \n603 U.S. at 610 (citation omitted); App., infra, 51a-53a (Katsas, J., dissenting).  Sec-\nond, whether or not directed at the President, the court\u2019s order restrains the exercise \nof the President\u2019s \u201c\u200a\u2018conclusive and preclusive\u2019\u200a\u201d powers\u2014which lie at the core of Article \nII, which \u201cCongress cannot act on,\u201d and which \u201ccourts cannot examine.\u201d  Trump, 603 \nU.S. at 609; see id. at 608-609 (identifying the removal, pardon, and recognition pow-\ners as examples of conclusive and preclusive powers).  \u201c[O]f course not all of the Pres-\nident\u2019s official acts fall within his \u2018conclusive and preclusive\u2019 authority.\u201d  Ibid.  Orders \nthat do not enjoin the President or that do not involve his conclusive powers would \nraise different questions that the Court need not address today.   \nMeanwhile, respondent ignores the larger floodgates that his position risks \nopening.  A TRO is an \u201cemergency\u201d order that a court should invoke only when the \nplaintiff faces an \u201cimmediate\u201d threat, and a TRO should last only until \u201cthere is an \nopportunity to hold a hearing on an application for a preliminary injunction.\u201d  11A \nCharles Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice & Procedure \u00a7 2951 (3d ed. 2024).  In \nrecent weeks, however, district judges have issued putative TROs that defy all those \n \n\n8 \nguardrails.  Courts have issued nationwide TROs, worldwide TROs, and TROs inter-\nfering with important Article II powers.1  If a TRO restraining the exercise of conclu-\nsive and preclusive Article II powers can escape appellate review, district courts are \nmore likely to be enticed into issuing more aggressive TROs.  Indeed, under respond-\nent\u2019s theory, a district court\u2019s notorious injunction against the bombing of Cambodia \nduring the Vietnam War would have been unreviewable had it simply been issued as \na 28-day-long TRO.  See Holtzman v. Schlesinger, 361 F. Supp. 553, 566 (E.D.N.Y.), \nrev\u2019d, 484 F.2d 1307 (2d Cir. 1973); see Holtzman v. Schlesinger, 414 U.S. 1316 (1973) \n(Douglas, J., in chambers) (vacating  the court of appeals\u2019 stay of the injunction); \nHoltzman v. Schlesinger, 414 U.S. 1321 (1973) (reinstating the stay).   \nAt bottom, the choice is not between an unworkable system where every TRO \ngets immediately appealed to the court of appeals and then reviewed in this Court, \nand respondent\u2019s alternative, where \u201cmore than 1,000 active and senior district court \njudges, sitting across 94 judicial districts,\u201d DHS v. New York, 140 S. Ct. 599, 600-601 \n(2020) (Gorsuch, J., concurring), can do as they please for up to 28 days without ap-\npellate review.  This Court controls its docket, and this Court controls the message \nlower courts take from the availability of further judicial review.  By vacating this \nTRO, this Court can remind district courts to respect the limits of their equitable \npowers and deter further abuse of TROs going forward. \n \n1  See, e.g., Doe v. McHenry, No. 25-cv-286, 2025 WL 388218, at *1 (D.D.C. Feb. \n4, 2025) (nationwide TRO blocking Executive Order directing the Attorney General \nto \u201censure that males are not detained in women\u2019s prisons\u201d) (citation omitted); AIDS \nVaccine Advocacy Coalition v. United States Department of State, No. 25-cv-400, 2025 \nWL 485324, at *6-*7 (D.D.C. Feb. 13, 2025) (worldwide TRO barring the \u201cDepartment \nof State\u201d from suspending any \u201cfederal foreign assistance award that was in existence \nas of January 19, 2025\u201d); New York v. Trump, No. 25-cv-1144, 2025 WL 435411, at *1 \n(S.D.N.Y. Feb. 8, 2025) (ex parte TRO denying \u201cpolitical appointees\u201d access to certain \nTreasury Department information), modified, 2025 WL 455406 (Feb. 11, 2025).   \n \n\n9 \nB.  The Government Is Likely To Succeed On The Merits  \n1.  As to the most important factor for vacatur\u2014likelihood of success on the \nmerits\u2014the TRO is untenable.  Article II vests the \u201centire \u2018executive Power\u2019\u200a\u201d in \u201cthe \nPresident alone,\u201d Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197, 213 (2020), yet the district \ncourt held that the executive power could continue to be exercised by a sole agency \nhead whom the President had removed.  This Court has \u201crecognized only two excep-\ntions to the President\u2019s unrestricted removal power,\u201d id. at 204, yet the district court \noverrode a removal that falls outside both exceptions.  This Court has held that \u201cthe \nConstitution prohibits even \u2018modest restrictions\u2019 on the President\u2019s power to remove \nthe head of an agency with a single top officer,\u201d Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220, 256 \n(2021) (citation omitted), yet the district court prevented the President from removing \nthe sole head of the Office of Special Counsel.  This Court has determined that \n\u201c[i]nvestigative and prosecutorial decisionmaking is the \u2018special province of the Exec-\nutive Branch,\u2019\u200a\u201d Trump, 603 U.S. at 620 (citation omitted), yet the district court de-\nprived the Executive of control of a self-described \u201cinvestigative and prosecutorial \nagency,\u201d https://osc.gov/Agency.  And this Court has explained that the President\u2019s \nexercise of the removal power \u201cmay not be  * * *  reviewed by the courts,\u201d Trump, 603 \nU.S. at 621, yet the district court insisted that the government \u201cjustify the immediate \nejection of the Senate-confirmed Special Counsel.\u201d  Appl. App. 28a.  \nRespondent\u2019s defenses underscore the weakness of his position.  First, respond-\nent for the first time in these proceedings reclassifies (Opp. 26-28) himself as an in-\nferior officer.  That is plainly wrong.  Someone is an inferior officer only if \u201c\u200a\u2018he has a \nsuperior\u2019 other than the President\u201d who has the authority to \u201cdirec[t] and supervis[e] \nhim.\u201d  United States v. Arthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. 1, 13 (2021) (quoting Edmond v. United \nStates, 520 U.S. 651, 662 (1997)).  Respondent suggests (Opp.8, 27, 36 n.12) that the \n \n\n10 \nMSPB has some control over his investigations, but the MSPB does not appoint or \nremove him.  Until recently, that was the President\u2019s job.  Now that the district court \nhas restored him to office and has barred the President from firing him even for cause, \nsee Appl. 21, he arguably is not inferior even to the President.  If respondent has any \nsuperior now, it is perhaps the district court\u2014but that hardly helps his cause.   \nFurther, respondent concedes (Opp. 3) that the Office of Special Counsel is a \nfreestanding \u201cfederal agency\u201d that is not contained within or subordinate to any other \nagency.  That means that the Office is a \u201cDepartmen[t]\u201d and the Special Counsel is \nits \u201cHea[d].\u201d  U.S. Const. Art. II, \u00a7 2, Cl. 2; see Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Co. \nAccounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 511 (2010).  Department heads, by definition, \ncannot be inferior officers.  See Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.S. 868, 884 (1991); \nid. at 917-918 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment).   \nRegardless, respondent\u2019s newfound claim to be an inferior officer does not save \nhis tenure protection.  In Myers, this Court held that Article II empowers the Presi-\ndent to remove \u201cinferior executive officers\u201d whom he has appointed.  272 U.S. at 161; \nsee id. at 158 (upholding the \u201cremoval of a postmaster\u201d even though \u201ca postmaster is \nan inferior officer\u201d).  True, this Court has upheld restrictions on the removal of certain \ninferior officers appointed by department heads, see United States v. Perkins, 163 \nU.S. 625 (1896), or by courts, see Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988).  But Myers \nholds that if Congress may restrict the removal of inferior executive officers at all, \nCongress may do so only if it has \u201cvest[ed] the appointment in some one other than \nthe President with the consent of the Senate.\u201d  272 U.S. at 162.  If an inferior officer \nis sufficiently important to require the Senate\u2019s participation in his appointment, \nthen the President must be able to fire him at will.  See id. at 161-162.  The Special \nCounsel is a sole agency head appointed by the President with the Senate\u2019s consent.  \n \n\n11 \nWhether he is a principal or inferior officer, the President may remove him at will.  \nSecond, respondent argues (Opp. 26-27) that the Special Counsel plays only a \n\u201climited\u201d role and that \u201cthe Special Counsel\u2019s powers do not resemble the authority \nof the principal officers who lead the CFPB and FHFA.\u201d  But Collins could not be \nclearer that \u201cthe Constitution prohibits even \u2018modest restrictions\u2019 on the President\u2019s \npower to remove the head of an agency with a single top officer\u201d; that the \u201cremoval \npower serves vital purposes even when the officer subject to removal is not the head \nof one of the largest and most powerful agencies\u201d; and that the scope of the removal \npower does not \u201ching[e] on\u201d \u201can inquiry\u201d into \u201cthe relative importance of the regula-\ntory and enforcement authority of disparate agencies.\u201d  594 U.S. at 252-253, 256 (ci-\ntation omitted); see id. at 273 (Kagan, J., concurring in part and concurring in the \njudgment) (\u201cAny \u2018agency led by a single Director,\u2019 no matter how much executive \npower it wields, now becomes subject to the requirement of at-will removal.\u201d) (citation \nomitted); see id. at 292 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) \n(\u201cAfter Seila Law, the Court reasons, all that matters is that \u2018the FHFA (like the \nCFPB) is an agency led by a single Director.\u2019\u200a\u201d) (citation omitted). \nThird, respondent appears to question (Opp. 29) whether the Special Counsel \nexercises \u201cexecutive power\u201d at all and argues that the Office promotes a \u201cshared inter-\nbranch interest.\u201d  But the Office describes itself as an \u201cinvestigatory and prosecutorial \nagency,\u201d https://osc.gov/Agency, that is located \u201cwithin the executive branch,\u201d U.S. \nOffice of Special Counsel Annual Report for Fiscal Year 2023, at 9.  \u201cInvestigative and \nprosecutorial decisionmaking is \u2018the special province of the Executive Branch,\u2019 and \nthe Constitution vests the entirety of the executive power in the President.\u201d  Trump, \n603 U.S. at 620 (citation omitted).  Respondent emphasizes (Opp. 27 n.8) that the \nSpecial Counsel brings enforcement actions before the Merit Systems Protection \n \n\n12 \nBoard rather than before Article III courts.  But the power to bring an administrative \nenforcement action is undoubtedly executive.  See United States v. Texas, 599 U.S. \n670, 679 (2023).  And the lack of an Article III check makes presidential oversight \nmore important, not less.  Respondent adds (Opp. 29) that the Special Counsel en-\nsures \u201ccompliance with congressionally imposed ethical and personnel requirements.\u201d  \nThat is a roundabout way of saying that he executes federal laws\u2014the very job of \nexecutive officers subject to the President\u2019s supervision and control.  \nFourth, respondent suggests (Opp. 30) that this Court should recognize a new \nexception to the President\u2019s removal power given the Office of Special Counsel\u2019s \n\u201cunique\u201d status and alleged \u201cneed for independence.\u201d  But this Court has made clear \nthat the President\u2019s \u201cunrestricted removal power\u201d is subject to \u201conly two exceptions\u201d; \nthat those exceptions represent \u201c\u200a\u2018the outermost constitutional limits of permissible \ncongressional restrictions\u2019\u200a\u201d; and that courts should not extend those exceptions to \n\u201c\u200a\u2018new situation[s],\u2019\u200a\u201d and certainly not to an agency led \u201cby a single individual.\u201d  Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 204, 218, 220 (citation omitted).  The Court\u2019s precedents leave no \nroom for a new exception for the sole head of the Office of Special Counsel. \nFinally, respondent incorrectly suggests (Opp. 25, 30) that this Court in Seila \nLaw endorsed the constitutionality of the Special Counsel\u2019s tenure restriction.  In \nfact, the Court pointedly observed that the Office of Special Counsel, which was \u201ccre-\nated nearly 200 years after the Constitution, drew a contemporaneous constitutional \nobjection from the Office of Legal Counsel under President Carter and a subsequent \nveto on constitutional grounds by President Reagan.\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 221.   \nThis is not a close case.  Because the Special Counsel is \u201cthe head of an agency \nwith a single top officer,\u201d the President \u201cmust be able to remove\u201d him at will.  Collins, \n594 U.S. at 256.  The Special Counsel\u2019s investigative and prosecutorial functions and \n \n\n13 \nthe Executive Branch\u2019s repeated constitutional objections to his tenure protection just \nadd \u201cextra icing [to] a cake already frosted.\u201d  Van Buren v. United States, 593 U.S. \n374, 394 (2021) (citation omitted).  \n2.  The foregoing aside, the district court\u2019s remedy departs so sharply from \nthis Court\u2019s precedents that the Court could vacate the TRO on that basis alone.  The \ndistrict court enjoined the President to restore respondent as Special Counsel, even \nthough the Court has held that a court may not \u201cenjoin the President in the perfor-\nmance of his official duties.\u201d  Mississippi, 4 Wall. at 501.  And the district court did \nso even though the Court has warned that the President cannot properly discharge \nhis responsibilities through subordinates who have been \u201cimposed upon him\u201d over his \nobjection, Myers, 272 U.S. at 132 (citation omitted); even though it is \u201cwell settled \nthat a court of equity has no jurisdiction over the appointment and removal of public \nofficers,\u201d In re Sawyer, 124 U.S. 200, 212 (1888); even though no American court ap-\npears ever to have issued an injunction restoring a removed agency head; and even \nthough respondent identifies no statute that purports to authorize such a remedy.  \nRespondent denies (Opp. 19) that the TRO actually enjoins the President.  But \nthe TRO provides that \u201cHampton Dellinger shall continue to serve as the Special \nCounsel,\u201d Appl. App. 29a, thus enjoining the President from removing him\u2014not even \nfor cause.  And the TRO binds the \u201cDefendants,\u201d ibid., who include, under respond-\nent\u2019s complaint, the President.  Thus, the district court believed that the President\u2019s \ndesignation of an Acting Special Counsel \u201cmay have been contrary to\u201d its order.  Id. \nat 29a n.8 (Katsas, J., dissenting).  At bottom, \u201cthe TRO necessarily targets the Pres-\nident\u2014the only official with the statutory and constitutional authority to appoint, \nremove, and supervise the Special Counsel.\u201d  Id. at 53a n.2.     \nRespondent\u2019s lack of any precedent supporting any order that prevents the \n \n\n14 \nPresident\u2019s removal of a principal executive officer speaks volumes.  Officers have \ntraditionally challenged their removals through suits for back pay.  Respondent notes \n(Opp. 33-34) that the officers in Myers and Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. United States, 295 \nU.S. 602 (1935), had died.  But Myers and Humphrey were, of course, very much alive \nat the time of their removals, yet neither sought an injunction restoring him to office.  \nEach waited, let back-pay claims accumulate, and eventually asserted those claims \nin court, directly or through an executor.  Myers was removed in February 1920, sued \nfor back pay in April 1921, and was later succeeded by his administratrix.  Myers, \n272 U.S. at 106, 108.  And Humphrey\u2019s executor sought salary due \u201cfrom October 8, \n1933, when the President undertook to remove him from office, to the time of his \ndeath on February 14, 1934.\u201d  Humphrey\u2019s Executor, 295 U.S. at 618.   \nRespondent also has no good answer to the wall of precedent establishing that \na court \u201cwill not, by injunction, restrain an executive officer from making a wrongful \nremoval.\u201d  White, 171 U.S. at 377 (citation omitted); see Appl. 23-24 (collecting cases).  \nRespondent observes (Opp. 32) that courts historically used writs such as \u201cquo war-\nranto\u201d to resolve disputes about title to public offices.  But respondent has sought and \nobtained a TRO (an equitable remedy), not a writ of quo warranto (which, as respond-\nent concedes, is a \u201cremedy in law,\u201d Opp. 32).  There are important differences between \nthe two remedies.  To begin, the D.C. Circuit \u201chas stated that [quo warranto] actions \nagainst public officials (as opposed to actions brought against officers of private cor-\nporations) can only be instituted by the Attorney General.\u201d  Andrade v. Lauer, 729 \nF.2d 1475, 1498 (1984); see Wallace v. Anderson, 5 Wheat. 291, 292 (1820) (Marshall, \nC.J.).  And a federal statute requires a plaintiff to follow special procedures before \n \n\n15 \ninstituting a quo warranto action.  See D.C. Code \u00a7\u00a7 16-3501 to 16-3503.2  He must \nfirst petition the Attorney General or U.S. Attorney to institute an action.  See id.  \n\u00a7 16-3502.  If those officials refuse, he must \u201capply to the court by certified petition \nfor leave to have the writ issued.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 16-3503.  The court \u201chas broad discretion to \ndeny the writ,\u201d Andrade, 729 F.2d at 1498, and may grant the writ only if \u201cthe reasons \nset forth in the petition are sufficient in law,\u201d D.C. Code \u00a7 16-3503.  And the plaintiff \nmust post \u201ca bond with sufficient surety\u201d for \u201call costs incurred in the prosecution of \nthe writ.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 16-3502.  Respondent skipped all those procedures.  He cannot now \novercome the traditional rule against issuing an \u201cinjunction\u201d to \u201crestrain\u201d \u201ca wrongful \nremoval,\u201d White, 177 U.S. at 377, by equating an injunction or TRO with the legal \nremedy of quo warranto.   \nRespondent suggests (Opp. 34-35) that, even though this Court has held that \ncourts may \u201cnot, by injunction, restrain  * * *  a wrongful removal,\u201d White, 171 U.S. \nat 377, courts should now invent such an equitable remedy in order to effectuate the \n\u201cstatutory design,\u201d Opp. 34.  But courts have no such authority.  Under Article I, the \n\u201cremedies available are those \u2018that Congress enacted into law\u2019\u200a\u201d; \u201ccourts may not cre-\nate [new remedies], no matter how desirable that might be as a policy matter, or how \ncompatible with the statute.\u201d  Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 287 (2001) (cita-\ntion omitted); see Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo S.A. v. Alliance Bond Fund, Inc., 527 \nU.S. 308, 332 (1999) (\u201c[T]he equitable powers conferred by the Judiciary Act of 1789 \ndid not include the power to create [new] remedies.\u201d).  At a minimum, courts should \nnot create such a remedy in the face of the serious Article II concerns raised by a \njudicial order preventing the President from removing a principal executive officer.  \n \n2  Although the relevant provisions are codified in the D.C. Code, they were \nenacted by Congress.  See District of Columbia Court Reform and Criminal Procedure \nAct of 1970, Pub. L. No. 91-358, 84 Stat. 561. \n \n\n16 \nSee Appl. 22-23; cf. Collins, 594 U.S. at 250 (requiring a clear statement before con-\ncluding that a statute restricts the removal power).   \nC.  The Equities Support Relief \nRespondent dismisses (Opp. 2, 37) the injury that the district court\u2019s order in-\nflicts on the President as too \u201cabstract\u201d and demands that the government identify \n\u201cconcrete\u201d \u201caction or inaction that [respondent] has taken that would result in irrep-\narable harm to the President\u2019s agenda\u201d to obtain relief.  But \u201ccourts cannot examine\u201d \n\u201cthe President\u2019s actions on subjects within his \u2018conclusive and preclusive\u2019 constitu-\ntional authority.\u201d  Trump, 603 U.S. at 609.  If a district court issued a TRO blocking \na pardon or the recognition of a foreign sovereign, this Court would surely vacate the \norder without requiring the President to explain how the TRO harms his agenda.  \nRemoval can hardly be a plenary presidential power if courts can demand that Pres-\nidents show an urgent need to exercise that it.  \nIn any event, the district court\u2019s order plainly inflicts concrete harm on the \nPresident.  The Special Counsel is not merely an officer; he is the head of an executive \ndepartment.  See p. 10, supra.  The statute empowers him to appoint subordinates in \nhis department, see 5 U.S.C. 1212(d)(1), and the Appointments Clause requires that \nhe be able to supervise inferior officers below him, see Arthrex, 594 U.S. at 13.  If the \nPresident loses control of the Special Counsel, he loses control of the Office.  It should \nbe self-evident that depriving the President of control over an entire executive de-\npartment in the earliest days of his administration inflicts irreparable harm.  \nThe district court\u2019s order also harms the government by threatening to cause \nthe mass invalidation of everything that the Special Counsel does during his court-\nordered, court-insulated tenure.  See Appl. 30.  Respondent denies (Opp. 37-38) that \nthe order would lead to such a result, but his argument conflicts with two clear rules \n \n\n17 \nset forth in Collins:  (1) \u201cthe Constitution prohibits even \u2018modest restrictions\u2019 on the \nPresident\u2019s power to remove the head of an agency with a single top officer,\u201d and (2) \nif \u201cthe President had attempted to remove a Director but was prevented from doing \nso by a lower court decision,\u201d the tenure restriction would \u201cinflict compensable harm.\u201d  \n594 U.S. at 256, 259 (citation omitted).  \nRespondent emphasizes (Opp. 15) that the district court\u2019s intrusion into the \nheartland of Article II \u201clasts only for a very short duration.\u201d  But there is no 14-day \nno-harm-no-foul exception to Article II for district court TROs.  Besides, if this Court \ndenies vacatur, the intrusions on Article II will last far longer.  The district court \nbegan by issuing a two-day \u201cadministrative stay\u201d that respondent has conceded was \neffectively a TRO.  See No. 25-5025 Resp. C.A. Opp. 11, 13.  The court then issued the \n14-day TRO at issue here.  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b), the court \ncould seek to extend that for 14 more days before issuing a preliminary injunction.  \nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b)(2).  Then, the Executive Branch may need to spend weeks \nmore litigating a stay motion in the district court, a stay motion in the court of ap-\npeals, and a stay application in this Court.  By the end, the President may be deprived \nof control of an entire executive department for over two months. \nRespondent next objects (Opp. 36) that the government\u2019s arguments regarding \nirreparable harm presuppose that the government is correct on the merits.  But ir-\nreparable harm and the merits are intertwined.  Respondent\u2019s counsel put the point \nwell when at a hearing in district court:  \u201cWith respect to irreparable harm, the only \nquestion is, assuming we\u2019re correct on the merits, which is always the standard for \nirreparable injury in an interim relief posture, assuming that we\u2019re otherwise meri-\ntorious,  * * *  is Hampton Dellinger going to experience some kind of irreparable \nharm in the interim while the Court considers the case?\u201d  2/10/25 D. Ct. Tr. 14-15.  \n \n\n18 \nJust so.  Assuming that the government is correct on the merits, the district court\u2019s \nusurpation of the President\u2019s exclusive removal power works irreparable harm.  \nOn the other side of the ledger, respondent fails to identify any irreparable \nharm to himself.  Respondent notes (Opp. 38) that a person who has been fired has \nsuffered an \u201cinjury,\u201d but the crucial point is that the injury is not irreparable.  A court \ncan repair an injury to an individual from loss of employment by awarding back pay. \nBut a court cannot repair the injury to the separation of powers, the President, and \nour democratic system from a judicial order that deprives the President of control of \nan executive department for several weeks.   \nThis Court should not allow district courts to enjoin the President\u2019s exercise of \nhis conclusive Article II powers and then tell the President to come back in two weeks \nor a month if he wants to appeal.  The United States respectfully asks that this Court \nvacate the district court\u2019s unprecedented order and restore the executive power to the \nperson whom the American people elected to exercise all of it\u2014the President. \n* *  *  *  *\nFor the foregoing reasons and those stated in the government\u2019s application, \nthis Court should vacate the district court\u2019s February 12, 2025 order granting re-\nspondent\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order.   \nRespectfully submitted. \nSARAH M.

Civil Action No. 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ \n   \nSCOTT BESSENT, et al.,   \n   \n \n        Defendants. \n \n \nDEFENDANTS\u2019 MOTION TO STAY THE COURT\u2019S ORDER PENDING APPEAL \nPlaintiff filed this action on February 10, 2025, ECF No. 1, challenging the President\u2019s decision \nto remove him as Special Counsel on February 7, 2025.  Plaintiff also moved for a temporary \nrestraining order, ECF No. 2.  Later that day, the Court entered an \u201cadministrative stay,\u201d ordering \nPlaintiff to be reinstated as Special Counsel through midnight on February 13.  See February 10, 2025 \nMinute Order.  On February 12, 2025, the Court granted Plaintiff\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining \norder, requiring that Plaintiff \u201cshall continue to serve as the Special Counsel\u201d and that Defendants \n\u201cmay not deny him access to the resources or materials of that office or recognize the authority of any \nother person as Special Counsel.\u201d  Order, ECF No. 14. \nThe parties agreed to consolidate the Court\u2019s consideration of the Plaintiff\u2019s request for a \npreliminary injunction with the merits, see February 15, 2025 Minute Order, and the parties cross-\nmoved for summary judgment.  See ECF Nos. 22, 23.  The Court held a hearing on February 26, 2025, \nthe day the temporary restraining order expired.  Later that day, the Court issued an order extending \nthe temporary restraining order for three days, through March 1, 2025.  See ECF No. 27.  On March \n1, 2025, the Court issued a memorandum opinion and order granting Plaintiff\u2019s cross-motion for \nsummary judgment and denying Defendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.  See ECF Nos. 32, 33.  \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 36     Filed 03/01/25     Page 2 of 5\nSpecifically, the order declared that Plaintiff \u201cis the Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel\u201d \nand that \u201cany recognition of an Acting Special Counsel in his place is unlawful.\u201d  ECF No. 33 at 1-2.  \nThe order also enjoined Defendants Bessent, Gor, Gorman, Kammann, and Vought, stating that they \n\u201cmust recognize [P]laintiff\u2019s title and position as Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel; \nthey must not obstruct or interfere with his performance of his duties; they must not deny him the \nauthority, benefits, or resources of his office; they must not recognize any Acting Special Counsel in \nhis place; and they must not treat him in any way as if he has been removed, or recognize any other \nperson as Special Counsel or as the head of the Office of Special Counsel, unless and until he is \nremoved from office in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a71211(b).\u201d  Id. at 2. \nThis relief constitutes an extraordinary intrusion into the President\u2019s authority.  Accordingly, \nDefendants have now appealed the Court\u2019s order and intend to request a stay pending appeal from \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.  Out of an abundance of caution to ensure \ncompliance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 8(a) (\u201cA party must ordinarily move first in the \ndistrict court for . . . a stay of the judgment or order of a district court pending appeal.\u201d), Defendants \nrespectfully move the Court to stay its order pending appeal. \n\u201c[T]he factors regulating the issuance of a stay are . . . (1) whether the stay applicant has made \na strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably \ninjured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties \ninterested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.\u201d  Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, \n776 (1987).  Here, these factors weigh decisively in favor of a stay. \nFirst, Defendants have made a \u201cstrong showing\u201d that they are likely to succeed on the merits.  \nThe Supreme Court has made clear\u2014twice, and recently\u2014that Article II precludes Congress from \nplacing limits on the President\u2019s authority to remove principal officers of the United States who serve \nas sole heads of an Executive Branch agency.  Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (2021); Seila Law LLC v. \nCFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020); see also Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5028, 2025 WL 559669, at *15 (D.C. Cir. \nFeb. 15, 2025) (Katsas, J., dissenting) (\u201cCongress cannot constitutionally restrict the President\u2019s power \nto remove the Special Counsel\u201d because the Special Counsel \u201cundoubtedly wields executive power.\u201d).  \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 36     Filed 03/01/25     Page 3 of 5\nOn that basis, President Biden in 2021 fired the single head of the Social Security Administration \nwithout cause.  Rodriguez v. SSA, 118 F.4th 1302, 1313-14 (11th Cir. 2024) (upholding President\u2019s \nability to fire head of SSA without cause); Kaufmann v. Kijakazi, 32 F.4th 843, 848-49 (9th Cir. 2022) \n(same).  In removing Plaintiff as the head of OSC, another Executive Branch agency with a single \nhead, the President merely exercised the same authority that President Biden did in removing the \nSocial Security Commissioner and that the Supreme Court recognized as lawful in Seila Law and Collins. \nIn addition, \u201c[a]n injunction preventing the President from firing an agency head\u2014and thus \ncontrolling how he performs his official duties\u2014is virtually unheard of.\u201d  Dellinger, 2025 WL 559669, \nat *14 (Katsas, J., dissenting).  The relief entered by this Court \u201cnecessarily targets the president\u2014the \nonly official with the statutory and constitutional authority to appoint, remove, and supervise the \nSpecial Counsel.\u201d  Id. at *13 n.2.  It also exceeds the scope of the Court\u2019s equitable powers.  Federal \ncourts\u2019 equitable authorities are those traditionally available to a court sitting in equity at the Founding, \nGrupo Mexicano de Desarrollo S.A. v. Alliance Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U.S. 308, 318 (1999), and the Supreme \nCourt has long held that a court cannot, \u201cby injunction, restrain an executive officer from making a \nwrongful removal of a subordinate appointee, nor restrain the appointment of another.\u201d  White v. Berry, \n171 U.S. 366, 377 (1898).  And the declaratory judgment entered in this case is \u201cessentially an equitable \ncause of action\u201d because it has \u201cvirtually the same practical impact as a formal injunction would.\u201d  \nSamuels v. Mackell, 401 U.S. 66, 70, 72 (1971).   \nSecond, the balance of equities and public interest overwhelmingly favor a stay pending appeal.  \nSee Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009) (noting that these factors merge in cases involving the \ngovernment).  As a result of the Court\u2019s order, a person the President has chosen to remove from \noffice is exercising executive power over the President\u2019s objection, a harm that is transparently \nirreparable.  Indeed, Plaintiff has already filed multiple administrative actions before the Merit Systems \nProtection Board (MSPB) challenging executive agencies\u2019 firings of probationary employees.  See U.S. \nOffice of Special Counsel, Special Counsel Dellinger Statement on Request that MSPB Stay Terminations of \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 36     Filed 03/01/25     Page 4 of 5\nProbationary Employees (Feb. 24, 2025).1  An MSPB member has granted the requested stays, according \n\u201c[d]eference\u201d to the Special Counsel\u2019s \u201cinitial determination.\u201d  Stay Order at 3, Special Counsel ex rel. \nJohn Doe v. Department (MSPB Feb. 25, 2025).2  Plaintiff then announced:  \u201cThese stays represent a \nsmall sample of the probationary employees who have been fired recently so our work is far from \ndone.\u201d  U.S. Office of Special Counsel, MSPB Grants Stays of Probationary Employee Terminations (Feb. \n25, 2025).3 \nConversely, Plaintiff has not established that he will suffer irreparable harm if the Court\u2019s \norder is stayed pending appeal.  Challenges to removals have historically been litigated through suits \nfor back pay, not reinstatement.  See, e.g., Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602, 618 (1935).   \nOSC\u2019s ability to function could be accomplished by means other than reinstating Plaintiff\u2014namely, \nthe appointment of a different individual as Special Counsel.  And reinstating Plaintiff would \npotentially void all actions taken by him as Special Counsel while the Government seeks further review \nof this case.  See Collins, 594 U.S. at 259 (private parties may be entitled to a remedy when an \nunconstitutional removal restriction \u201cinflict[s] compensable harm,\u201d such as if \u201cthe President had \nattempted to remove [an agency head] but was prevented from doing so by a lower court decision\u201d). \nFor these reasons, the Court should grant a stay of its order pending resolution of Defendants\u2019 \nappeal. \n \n \nDated: March 1, 2025          Respectfully submitted, \n               \n              YAAKOV M.

A to Compl. [Dkt. # 1-1] (\u201cEx. A\u201d).   \nAs of the close of the business day on February 7, 2025, plaintiff Hampton Dellinger was \nthe Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel, having been appointed to a five-year term \nby the President of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate.  In that position, \nhe served as the head of the small independent agency tasked with shielding federal employees \nfrom prohibited personnel practices, including retaliation for whistleblowing, in the workplace.  \n  At 7:22 p.m. that evening, he received the email message above from Sergio N. Gor, \nAssistant to the President, Director of Presidential Personnel Office, The White House, with no \nadditional explanation or reasoning. \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 2 of 67\nOn Monday, February 10, 2025, plaintiff filed this action to assert his entitlement to the \nposition of Special Counsel and prevent the defendants from interfering with or removing him \nfrom that role.  See Compl. [Dkt. # 1].  He sued Scott Bessent, in his official capacity as Secretary \nof the Treasury; Sergio Gor, in his official capacity as Director of the White House Presidential \nPersonnel Office; Karen Gorman, in her official capacity as Principal Deputy Special Counsel; \nKarl Kammann, in his official capacity as the Chief Operating Officer of the Office of Special \nCounsel; Donald J. Trump, in his official capacity as President of the United States; and Russell \nVought, in his official capacity as Director of the Office of Management and Budget.  See Compl. \nat 1.    \nAt the same time, plaintiff moved for a temporary restraining order to enjoin the effort to \nterminate him.  Pl.\u2019s Mot. for a TRO [Dkt. # 2] (\u201cMot. for TRO\u201d).  The proceedings and rulings \nthat followed will be set out in detail below.  For purposes of this introduction, it is important to \nadd that plaintiff later moved for a motion for preliminary injunction as well, and the Court \nscheduled a hearing.  In the interim, with the parties\u2019 consent, the Court consolidated the motion \nfor a preliminary injunction with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 65(b).  See Minute Order (Feb. 15, 2025). \nOn February 21, defendants moved for summary judgment in their favor.  Defs.\u2019 Mot. for \nSumm. J. [Dkt. # 22] (\u201cDefs.\u2019 Mot.\u201d).  On February 24, plaintiff filed a combined opposition to \ndefendants\u2019 motion, cross-motion for summary judgment on Count 1, and motion for permanent \ninjunction.  Pl.\u2019s Cross-Mot. for Summ. J. and Permanent Inj. and Opp. to Defs.\u2019 Mot. [Dkt. # 23] \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 3 of 67\n(\u201cPl.\u2019s Mot.\u201d).  The motions are fully briefed,1 and on February 26, the Court held a lengthy hearing \non the consolidated motions.  See Minute Entry (Feb. 26, 2025).   \nThere is no dispute that the statute establishing the Office of Special Counsel provides that \nthe Special Counsel may be removed by the President only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or \nmalfeasance in office, and that the curt email from the White House informing the Special Counsel \nthat he was terminated contained no reasons whatsoever.  This is the basis for Count 1, which \nalleges that the termination was an unlawful, ultra vires action, and the basis for plaintiff\u2019s \nassertion that he is entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 37\u201341.  The Court will \ngrant plaintiff\u2019s motion and enter judgment in his favor.2 \n  Defendants take the position that the statutory provision is unconstitutional and should be \nstruck down rather than enforced.  They insist that the President of the United States must have \ncontrol over the head of this small federal agency, as he does over all administrative agencies, \nnotwithstanding its narrow focus and its negligible impact on private actors or any sector of the \neconomy.  Plaintiff does not disagree with that.  Congress did not disagree with that.  It enshrined \nPresidential control in the statute by providing that he may remove the Special Counsel for the \n \n1   On February 25, defendants filed a combined reply in support of their summary judgment \nmotion and opposition to plaintiff\u2019s cross-motion.  Defs.\u2019 Reply in Supp. of Defs.\u2019 Mot. and Resp. \nin Opp. to Pl.\u2019s Mot. [Dkt. # 25] (\u201cDefs.\u2019 Reply\u201d).  On February 27, plaintiff filed his combined \nreply in support of his cross-motion and opposition to the government\u2019s motion for summary \njudgment.  See Reply in Supp. of Pl.\u2019s Mot. and Opp. to Defs.\u2019 Mot. [Dkt. # 29] (\u201cPl.\u2019s Reply\u201d).     \n \n2   Given  that  determination,  the  Court  need  not  reach  Count  Two,  Compl.  \u00b6\u00b6  42\u201343, \npredicated on the Administrative Procedure Act, or Count Four predicated on the constitutional \nseparation of powers and the Take Care Clause.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 46\u201347.  The other counts \u2013 Count \nThree for declaratory judgment, Count Five for writ of mandamus, and Count Six for injunctive \nrelief \u2013 relate to the remedies sought.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 44\u201345, 48\u201350, 51\u201352.  The ruling also means that \ndefendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment will be denied. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 4 of 67\nthree relatively broad, but specified reasons.  Defendants maintain, though, that the Constitution \ndemands that the President should have unfettered authority to fire him for no reason at all.  \nIn short, the question presented in this case is whether it is an unconstitutional intrusion on \nthe President\u2019s Article II powers to say that he may remove the Special Counsel for reasons related \nto his performance, but he cannot do it on a whim or out of personal animus.  It is an extremely \nnarrow question with little or no precedential value given the sui generis nature of the Office of \nSpecial Counsel, and the fact that there is no longer any other agency with a single head, protected \nby similar restrictions, in the executive branch.  \nThe Court finds that the statute is not unconstitutional.  And it finds that the elimination of \nthe restrictions on plaintiff\u2019s removal would be fatal to the defining and essential feature of the \nOffice of Special Counsel as it was conceived by Congress and signed into law by the President:  \nits independence.  The Court concludes that they must stand.   \nA review of both the statutory provisions setting out the powers and functions of the Office \nof Special Counsel, and the history of the legislation establishing the Special Counsel\u2019s position \nand the terms of his tenure, reveals that his independence is inextricably intertwined with the \nperformance of his duties.  The Special Counsel\u2019s job is to look into and expose unethical or \nunlawful practices directed at federal civil servants, and to help ensure that whistleblowers who \ndisclose fraud, waste, and abuse on the part of government agencies can do so without suffering \nreprisals.  It would be ironic, to say the least, and inimical to the ends furthered by the statute if \nthe Special Counsel himself could be chilled in his work by fear of arbitrary or partisan removal. \nMoreover, striking down the removal provision in the statute is not necessary for any of \nthe reasons that have animated the invalidation of similar restrictions in the past.  This Court\u2019s \nruling that the attempt to terminate the Special Counsel was unlawful is entirely consistent with \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 5 of 67\nthe decisions reached and the legal framework set forth in the Supreme Court\u2019s most recent \nopinions on this subject:  Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Collins v. \nYellen.   \nFirst, those cases do not require a finding that the removal protections on the Special \nCounsel are unconstitutional because they expressly acknowledge that the Office of Special \nCounsel is not at all comparable to the agencies they were addressing.   \nSecond, and more importantly, this case does not present the affront to the President\u2019s \nArticle II authority that those did.  What troubled the Court in both Seila Law and Collins were \nrestrictions on the President\u2019s ability to remove an official who wields significant executive \nauthority.  The Special Counsel simply does not.  He cannot bring a case in court on behalf of the \nUnited States, impose a disciplinary sanction on behalf of the United States, demand payment on \nbehalf of the United States, promulgate a regulation on behalf of the United States, or issue a \ndecision on behalf of the United States.  While he may perform some typically executive functions, \nsuch as conducting investigations, he has no power to enforce his own subpoenas or to overcome \nother agencies\u2019 objections to his requests for records.  If an inquiry reveals wrongdoing, he cannot \nbring  a  complaint  or  call  for  corrective  action  himself;  he  must  petition  a  multi-headed \nquasi-judicial agency, or the appropriate administrative agency under Presidential control itself, to \n \ndo so.  They are free to turn him down.  \nThe  Special  Counsel  acts  as  an  ombudsman,  a  clearinghouse  for  complaints  and \nallegations, and after looking into them, he can encourage the parties to resolve the matter among \nthemselves.  But if that fails, he must direct them elsewhere.  And along the way, while he is \nrequired to inform the President of certain findings, the statute also specifically directs him to \nreport directly to Congress. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 6 of 67\nThis is not significant executive authority.  It is hardly executive authority at all. \nFinally, the underlying assumption of Seila Law and Collins is that a President necessarily \noperates through his executive agencies as he performs his duty to take care that the laws are \nfaithfully executed.  Therefore, the President must be able to not only choose, but also remove, \nagency heads, because their jobs entail serving as an extension of his own executive authority. \nPlaintiff does not take issue with that proposition either.  But he maintains that the Special Counsel \nis unique in that he cannot be characterized in that manner.  The Office of Special Counsel is not \nassigned responsibilities that include furthering the administration\u2019s agenda; it is the Special \nCounsel\u2019s job to look into and shine light on a set of specific prohibited practices so that the other \nbodies, in the appropriate exercise of their constitutional authority, can take whatever action they \ndeem to be appropriate.  To do this as Congress intended that he should, he must remain entirely \nfree of partisan or political influence, and that is why the statute survives scrutiny even under the \nmost recent precedent. \nIn sum, it would be antithetical to the very existence of this particular government agency \nand position to vindicate the President\u2019s Article II power as it was described in Humphrey\u2019s \nExecutor:  a constitutional license to bully officials in the executive branch into doing his will.   \n  For those reasons and the reasons stated below, plaintiff\u2019s cross-motion for summary \njudgment [Dkt.  # 23] will be  GRANTED, and defendants\u2019 motion  for summary judgment \n[Dkt. # 22] will be DENIED.     \n \n \n \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 7 of 67\nBACKGROUND \nA.  Legislative History \nThe Special Counsel is the head of the Office of Special Counsel (\u201cOSC\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1211(a), an independent agency of the United States with a century-old origin and a history of \nfulfilling its statutory function spanning twelve presidential administrations.   \nThe OSC was created within the context of the laws that first established the concept of a \ncorps of federal civil servants and, over time, defined their rights and obligations.  This began with \nthe Pendleton Civil Service Act of 1883 (\u201cPendleton Act\u201d), 22 Stat. 403 (1883),3 which created a \n\u201cclassified\u201d federal civil service and \u201crequired competitive examination for entry into that service.\u201d \nArnett v. Kennedy, 416 U.S. 134, 149 (1974).  For almost a century before the Pendleton Act, \n\u201cfederal employment was regarded as an item of patronage, which could be granted, withheld, or \nwithdrawn for whatever reasons might appeal to the responsible executive hiring officer.\u201d  Id. at \n148.  The resulting spoils system was \u201coften . . . treated as a method of rewarding support at the \npolls,\u201d Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, 426 U.S. 88, 107 (1976), and that gave rise to a federal \nworkforce where employees were selected and advanced based on political or personal favoritism, \nrather than competence.  S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 2\u20133 (1978). \n \n3   The National Archives has transcribed the full text of the Pendleton Act, which can be \nfound  at  Pendleton  Act  (1883),  Nat\u2019l  Archive  (last  reviewed  Feb.  8,  2022), \nhttps://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/pendleton-\nact#:~:text=Approved%20on%20January%2016%2C%201883%2C%20the%20Pendleton%20A\nct,passed%20the%20Pendleton%20Act%20in%20January%20of%201883. \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 8 of 67\nGrowing \u201csentiment for \u2018Civil Service reform\u2019\u201d in the wake of the Civil War and the \nsubsequent assassination of President James A.

As the \nSenate Report on the legislation described: \nThe single, simple, fundamental, pivotal idea of the whole bill is, that \nwhenever, hereafter, a new appointment or a promotion shall be made in the \nsubordinate  civil  service  in  the  departments  or  larger  offices,  such \nappointment or promotion shall be given to the man who is best fitted to \ndischarge the duties of the position, and that such fitness shall be ascertained \nby open, fair, honest, impartial competitive examination. The impartiality \nof those examinations is to be secured by every possible safeguard. They \nare to be open to all who choose to present themselves.

No. 95-969, at 4, the \nPendleton Act created the United States Civil Service Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d), consisting of \nthree commissioners appointed by the President.  22 Stat. 403.  \u201cThe Commission\u2019s job was to \nscreen, examine, and present a choice of applicants to fill jobs in the agencies.\u201d  S.

S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 1.  In the meantime, it had become clear that the Civil \nService Commission did not \u201cserve[] particularly well\u201d as a management agency.  Id. at 5.  \nAlthough the Commission was not originally intended to be a \u201ccentral personnel agency,\u201d over \ntime, it had \u201cassumed full [administrative] responsibility\u201d over the vast majority of the federal \nworkforce.  Id.

Id. at 1\u20132.  On March 2, 1978, President Carter sent a letter to Congress with \nhis proposal for \u201ca comprehensive program to reform the Federal Civil Service system,\u201d intended \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 10 of 67\nto \u201cincrease the government\u2019s efficiency\u201d while \u201censuring that employees and the public are \nprotected against political abuse of the system.\u201d  President Jimmy Carter, Federal Civil Service \nMessage to Congress (Mar. 2, 1978) (\u201cPresident Carter Letter\u201d).5  Among other things, he \nproposed to replace the Civil Service Commission with two agencies:  (1) the Office of Personnel \nManagement, which would be the \u201ccenter for personnel  administration\u201d; and (2) the Merit \nProtection Board, which would be \u201cthe adjudicatory arm of the new personnel system.\u201d  Id.  As \npart of the Merit Protection Board, President Carter proposed the creation of a \u201cSpecial Counsel,\u201d \nwho  would  \u201cinvestigate  and  prosecute  political  abuses  and  merit  system  violations,\u201d  and \n\u201csafeguard the rights\u201d of employees who \u201c\u2018blow the whistle\u2019 on violations of laws.\u201d  Id.  In his \nletter, President Carter emphasized the need for \u201cindependent and impartial protection\u201d for federal \nemployees.

As the Senate Report detailing the Act\u2019s history describes, Congress adopted President \nCarter\u2019s recommendation by \u201cprovid[ing] for an independent merit systems protection board and \nspecial counsel to adjudicate employee appeals and protect the merit system.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 95-\n969, at 2.  Both entities were intended to protect employees from \u201cimproper political influences or \npersonal favoritism in the recruiting, hiring, promotion, or dismissal processes,\u201d and \u201cto protect \nindividuals who speak out about government wrongdoing from reprisals.\u201d  Id. at 18.

As part of the MSPB, the Special Counsel would \n\u201creceive and investigate allegations of prohibited personnel practices in violation of the merit \nsystem,\u201d with a \u201cmandate to . . . prevent reprisals against government \u2018whistle blowers.\u2019\u201d  Id.   \nThe whistleblower mandate was particularly important to Congress: \nProtecting  employees  who  disclose  government  illegality,  waste,  and \ncorruption is a major step toward a more effective civil service.  In the vast \nfederal bureaucracy it is not difficult to conceal wrongdoing provided that \nno one summons the courage to disclose the truth.  Whenever misdeeds take \nplace in a federal agency, there are employees who know that it has \noccurred, and who are outraged by it.  What is needed is a means to assure \nthem that they will not suffer if they help uncover and correct administrative \nabuses.  What is needed is a means to protect the Pentagon employee who \ndiscloses billions of dollars in cost overruns, the GSA employee who \ndiscloses widespread fraud, and the nuclear engineer who questions the \nsafety of certain nuclear plants.  These conscientious civil servants deserve \nstatutory protection rather than bureaucratic harassment and intimidation.   \n \nId. at 8.   \n \nGiven their roles, Congress intended the MSPB and the Special Counsel to be \u201cindependent \nof any control or direction by the President.\u201d  Id. at 24.  But the legislators struggled to define the \nSpecial Counsel.  The original draft of the CSRA set a seven-year term limit for the Special \nCounsel, id. at 29, the same term length as members of the MSPB.  Id. at 28.  Believing that a \nseven-year term \u201cwas too long,\u201d Congress later amended the term to a four-year term coterminous \nwith the President, id., which matched President Carter\u2019s proposed legislation.  Reorganization \nPlan No. 2 of 1978, 43 Fed. Reg. 36037, 36039 (Aug. 15, 1978).  But Congress noted the need for \na for-cause removal restriction on the Special Counsel, explaining: \nBecause the Special Counsel may be called upon to investigate prohibited \npersonnel  practices  in  the  executive  branch,  and  to  bring  disciplinary \nactions against executive branch officials, the Committee believed it is \nessential that the Special Counsel be independent of presidential direction \nand control.  Accordingly, subsection (b) was added by the Committee to \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 12 of 67\nprovide that the Special Counsel may be removed by the president only for \ninefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. \n \nS. Rep. No. 95-969, at 29.   \n \nThe debate did not stop there.  Senators Charles Mathias (R-Md.) and Ted Stevens \n(R-Alaska) took issue with a shortened term, arguing: \n \n[The Special Counsel] would be responsible for investigating prohibited \npersonnel practices and prosecuting those who commit such practices.  \nAppointed by the President with the consent of the Senate to serve during \nthe president\u2019s term, he would be, and would be perceived as being, a \npolitical appointee serving at the pleasure of the administration.  How then \nwould  it  be  possible  for  the  special  counsel  to  initiate,  thoroughly \ninvestigate, and then take actions which by their very nature could prove \nembarrassing to the administration?  To be effective and to enjoy the \nconfidence of the people, the Special Counsel must be insulated from overt \nand subtle influences of the president and his appointees.  \nId. at 134.  And, on the other side, there was objection to the for-cause removal restriction on the \nSpecial Counsel\u2019s position.  Commenting on a draft of the CSRA that included the seven-year \nterm, the Office of Legal Counsel (\u201cOLC\u201d) issued an opinion that Congress could \u201cnot properly \nlimit\u201d the President\u2019s power to remove the Special Counsel because his functions were \u201cexecutive \nin character.\u201d  Mem. Op. for the Gen. Couns., Civ. Serv. Comm\u2019n, 2 Op.

The final version of the Civil Services Reform Act passed by Congress created the \n\u201cSpecial Counsel of the Merits Systems Protection Board\u201d to serve a five-year term with removal \nonly for cause.

Specifically, Congress agreed to \u201cdelete provisions . . . that would give \nthe Special Counsel the authority to go to court to appeal MSPB decisions and enforce subpoenas,\u201d \nand to \u201cdrop the provision . . . that would authorize the Special Counsel to appeal MSPB decisions \nto the Federal circuit court.\u201d  135 Cong. Rec. 4509 (1989) (statement of Sen. Carl Levin).  At the \nsame time, the law, as originally envisioned, removed the OSC from its place within the MSPB, \nestablished it as an independent agency, and retained the for-cause removal protection for the \nSpecial Counsel.  Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, Pub. L. 101-12, 103 Stat. 16 (1989). \n  On March 3, 1989, Attorney General Thornburgh sent a letter to the sponsor of the Act, \nSenator Carl Levin (D-Mich.), confirming the administration\u2019s support of the revised bill and \n \nthanking him \u201cfor his efforts in working with us to forge a mutually acceptable resolution of our \nserious constitutional concerns.\u201d 135 Cong. Rec. 5033\u201334 (1989).  Congress then passed the \n \n8   The President\u2019s other \u201cmajor objection\u201d to the Whistleblower Act\u201d was that it \u201cessentially \nrig[ged] the [MSPB]\u2019s process against agency personnel managers in favor of employees\u201d by \n\u201csubstantially reduc[ing] the factual showing required of the employee and . . . substantially \nincreas[ing] the burden on agencies.\u201d  President Reagan Mem. at 1378.    \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 17 of 67\nrevised Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211 et seq., and President George H.W. \nBush signed it into law on April 10, 1989.  Statement by President George Bush Upon Signing \nS.20, 25 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 516 (Apr. 10, 1989) (\u201cPresident Bush Statement\u201d).  President \nBush noted the \u201csubstantial improvement\u201d in the bill\u2019s \u201cdeletion of provisions that would have \nenabled the Special Counsel, an executive branch official, to oppose other executive branch \nagencies in court.\u201d  Id.  And he further stated, \u201cI am pleased that the Administration was able to \nwork in a spirit of cooperation and bipartisanship with both Houses of Congress to resolve our \ndifferences and enact this important legislation.\u201d Id.  \n  Congress has reappropriated funds to the Office of Special Counsel every year since the \npassage of the Whistleblower Protection Act, see, e.g., Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, \nPub. L. 118-47, 138 Stat 460 (Mar. 23, 2024), and it has adjusted the Special Counsel\u2019s authority \nseveral times.   \nIn 1994, at the previous \u201crequest of the Bush Administration,\u201d S. Rep. No. 1035-358, at 4 \n(1994), Congress passed an act reauthorizing both the Special Counsel and the Merits System \nProtection Board.  United States Office of Special Counsel, Merits System Protection Board: \nAuthorization (\u201c1994 Reauthorization Act\u201d), Pub. L. No. 103-424, 108 Stat. 4361 (1994).  In \naddition to reauthorizing the Special Counsel for three years, the Act clarified \u201cthe rules governing \nOSC disclosure of information about whistleblowers,\u201d \u201crequir[ed] OSC to provide appropriate \ninformation to whistleblowers whose cases have been closed,\u201d \u201c[e]stablish[ed] a fixed time limit \nfor OSC to take action on whistleblower cases,\u201d and \u201censur[ed] that whistleblowers ha[d] access \nto relevant evidence in the event that they bring their own cases to the [MSPB].\u201d  S. Rep. No. 103-\n358, at 2.

Clinton Upon Signing, 30 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 2202 (Oct. \n25, 1994) (\u201cPresident Clinton Statement\u201d).       \n  Almost two decades later, Congress passed the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement \nAct of 2012 (\u201cWPEA\u201d), Pub. L. 112-199, 126 Stat. 1465 (2012), to \u201cstrengthen the rights of and \nprotections for federal whistleblowers so that they can more effectively help root out waste, fraud, \nand abuse in the federal government.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 112-155, at 1 (2012).  The act \u201cprovide[d] for \ncertain authority for the Special Counsel,\u201d id., specifically, its amicus curiae authority that \nCongress found \u201cnecessary to ensure the OSC\u2019s effectiveness.\u201d  Id. at 12\u201314.   \nAs the Senate Report on the bill explained, when a federal employee brings allegations of \na prohibited personnel practice to the Special Counsel, he \u201cinvestigates . . . to determine whether \nthere are reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice has occurred.\u201d  Id. at \n13.  If he makes a positive determination, he notifies the agency involved so that it can take \ncorrective action, and if it refuses, he \u201cis authorized to file a petition for corrective action with the \nMSPB.\u201d  Id.  But after the MSPB renders a decision, the Special Counsel\u2019s ability to \u201cenforce and \ndefend whistleblower laws in the context of that claim is limited,\u201d because he \u201cdoes not have \nauthority to ask the MSPB to reconsider its decision,\u201d 10 and he cannot \u201cseek review of an MSPB \ndecision by the Federal Circuit.\u201d  Id.  Further, \u201c[b]ecause the OSC lacks independent litigating \n \n9   According to President Clinton\u2019s statement upon signing the Reauthorization Act, he had \n\u201cbeen advised that one provision in this bill (section 9), which concerns the apparent authority of \nan arbitrator to discipline a Federal employee who was not a party to the original action, raises \nserious constitutional questions.\u201d  President Clinton Statement at 2022. \n \n10   As the report explained, \u201cIn contrast, the Office of Personnel Management . . . , which \ntypically is not a party to the case, can request that the MSPB reconsider its rulings.\u201d  S. Rep.

Id.  Therefore, Congress authorized the Special Counsel to \u201cappear as amicus \ncuriae in any\u201d prohibited personnel practice case brought to the federal court by the aggrieved \nemployee.  WPEA, Pub. L. No. 112-199, \u00a7 113, 126 Stat. 1465, 1472 (2012).  President Barack \nObama signed the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act into law on November 27, 2012.  \nStatement by Press Secretary on H.R. 2606, H.R. 4114, S. 743 and S. 1956, White House Off. of \nCommc\u2019ns (Nov. 27, 2012). \n  Finally, in 2018, Congress reauthorized the Special Counsel in the omnibus National \nDefense Authorization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-91, 131 Stat. 1283 (2018).  That legislation clarified \nthe type of information that federal agencies subject to an OSC investigation could or could not \nwithhold from the agency.  Id.  And it established another reporting obligation on the OSC by \nrequiring it to submit an annual report to Congress regarding the agency\u2019s activities.  Id.  President \nDonald Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act into law, noting \u201cthe longstanding \nposition of the executive branch that . . . insulation of a principal officer like the Special Counsel \nraises serious constitutional concerns.\u201d  Statement by President Donald J. Trump on H.R. 2810, \nWhite House Off. of Commc\u2019ns (Dec. 12, 2017). \nB.  Statutory Background \nAs it is currently constituted, the Office of the Special Counsel is led by the Special \nCounsel, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(a), who is \u201cappointed by the President, by and with the advice and \nconsent of the Senate\u201d to serve \u201cfor a term of 5 years.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1211(b).  Congress requires that the \nSpecial Counsel must \u201cbe an attorney who, by demonstrated ability, background, training, or \nexperience, is especially qualified to carry out the functions of the position.\u201d  Id.  And, by statute, \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 20 of 67\n\u201c[t]he Special Counsel may be removed by the President only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or \nmalfeasance in office.\u201d  Id.    \nThe Special Counsel and the OSC are authorized to operate in four primary ways.  First, \nthe agency acts as a confidential channel for federal employees to disclose \u201cinformation\u201d that the \nindividual \u201creasonably believes evidences\u201d:  (1) \u201ca violation of any law, rule, or regulation\u201d;  \n(2) \u201cgross mismanagement\u201d;  (3) \u201ca gross waste of funds\u201d;  (4) \u201can abuse of authority\u201d; or (5) a \n\u201csubstantial and specific danger to public health or safety.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1213(a)(1)(A)\u2013(B).  Without the \nindividual\u2019s consent, the \u201cidentity of any individual who makes a disclosure . . . may not be \ndisclosed by the Special Counsel\u201d unless he determines that disclosure is necessary to avoid \n\u201cimminent danger to public health and safety or imminent violation of any criminal law.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 1213(h).   \nUpon receipt of a disclosure, the Special Counsel has forty-five days to determine whether \nthere  is  a  \u201csubstantial  likelihood\u201d  that  the  information  reveals  a  violation  of  law,  gross \nmismanagement or waste of funds, abuse of authority, or danger to public health or safety.  Id. \n\u00a7 1213(b).  If the Special Counsel makes a positive determination, he must transmit the disclosed \ninformation to the appropriate agency head, and direct the agency head to investigate and submit \na written report of their findings to the Special Counsel.  Id. \u00a7 1213(c)(1).  The Special Counsel \nthen reviews the report, gives the whistleblower an opportunity to comment, and adds any of his \nown \u201ccomments or recommendations.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1213(e)(1), (3).  The Special Counsel is then required \nto  submits  the  agency\u2019s  report,  the  whistleblower\u2019s  comments,  and  his  comments  or \nrecommendations \u201cto the President and the congressional committees with jurisdiction over the \nagency.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1213(e)(3).  And any case involving \u201cevidence of a criminal violation\u201d is referred \nto the Attorney General.  Id. \u00a7 1213(f).   \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 21 of 67\nSecond, the agency is authorized to \u201creceive and investigate allegations of prohibited \npersonnel practices.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1212(a)(2).  Among other things, prohibited personnel practices include \ndiscrimination, coerced political activity, willful obstruction of an individual\u2019s right to compete \nfor employment, and reprisal for whistleblowing. Id. \u00a7 2302(b)(1)\u2013(14) (defining \u201cprohibited \npersonnel practice\u201d).   \nWithin 240 days of receiving an allegation of a prohibited practice, the Special Counsel \nmust determine whether \u201cthere are reasonable grounds to believe\u201d that the practice has occurred, \nexists, or will occur.  See id. \u00a7 1214(b)(2)(A)(i).  He can also, \u201cin the absence of an allegation, \nconduct  an  investigation\u201d  to  determine  whether  there  are  reasonable  grounds  to  believe  a \nprohibited practice, \u201cor a pattern of prohibited\u201d practices, has occurred, exists, or will be taken.  \nId. \u00a7 1214(a)(5).  In furtherance of his investigatory duty, the OSC may \u201cissue subpoenas\u201d and \norder \u201cthe taking of depositions\u201d and \u201cresponses to written interrogatories.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1212(b)(2).  If \na party fails to obey a subpoena issued, \u201cthe Special Counsel may apply to the Merit Systems \nProtection Board to enforce [it] in court.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1212(b)(3)(A).  The Special Counsel is authorized \nto  \u201chave  timely  access  to  all  records,  data,  reports,  audits,  reviews,  documents,  papers, \nrecommendations,  or  other  material  available  to  the  applicable  agency  that  relate  to  an \ninvestigation,\u201d id. \u00a7 1212(b)(5)(A)(i), but there are some exceptions.  The Inspector General may \nwithhold material \u201ccontain[ing] information derived from, or pertaining to intelligence activities,\u201d \nid. \u00a7 1212(b)(5)(B)(ii), and the Inspector or Attorney General may withhold material reasonably \n\u201cexpected to interfere with a criminal investigation or prosecution.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1212(b)(5)(B)(iii)(I)(aa).   \nIf the Special Counsel determines that there are reasonable grounds, he reports that \ndetermination to the head of the agency involved, along with the MSPB and the OPM, so that it \ncan remedy the action.  Id. \u00a7 1214(b)(2)(B).   \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 22 of 67\nThe OSC refers certain cases to its Alternative Dispute Resolution Unit, which may \nconduct voluntary mediation between the employing agency and the employee.  See Alternative \nDispute  Resolution  Process,  Off.  of  Special  Counsel,  https://osc.gov/Services/Pages/ADR-\nOurProcess.aspx  (last  visited  Feb.  22,  2024).    A  report  by  the  MSPB  in  2010  stated  that \n\u201c[t]ypically, OSC obtains corrective action through negotiation between the complainant and the \nagency.\u201d   See Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., Whistleblower Protections for Federal Employees:  A Report \nto the President and the Congress of the United States 43 (2010).  But if the agency does not take \ncorrective action, \u201cafter a reasonable period of time,\u201d the Special Counsel \u201cmay petition the Board \nfor corrective action.\u201d  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1214(b)(2)(C).  When he petitions for corrective action, the \nMSPB provides an opportunity for him to submit \u201coral or written comments\u201d on the matter.  Id. \n\u00a7 1214(b)(3)(A).  The Special Counsel may also request that the MSPB \u201corder a stay of any \npersonnel action for 45 days\u201d if he \u201cdetermines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that \nthe personnel action\u201d would be taken \u201cas a result of a prohibited personnel practice.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 1214(b)(1)(A)(i).  And if the Special Counsel believes disciplinary action should be taken, he \nmust prepare a written complaint to the MSPB.  Id. \u00a7 1215(a)(1)(A). \nThe Special Counsel does not have independent authority to appeal or otherwise litigate a \ndecision by the MSPB.  If an employee exercises their right to appeal an MSPB decision to federal \ncourt, \u201c[t]he Special Counsel is authorized to appear as amicus curiae . . . to present the views of \nthe Special Counsel . . . and the impact court decisions would have on the enforcement of such \nprovisions of law.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1212(h)(1).   \nSimilarly, the Special Counsel is also empowered to \u201creview rules and regulations\u201d issued \nby the Office of Personnel Management, and he must \u201cfile a written complaint\u201d with the MSPB if \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 23 of 67\nhe \u201cfinds that any such rule or regulation would, on its face or as implemented, require the \ncommission of a prohibited personnel practice.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1212(a)(4).     \nThird, the Special Counsel has authority to investigate violations of the Hatch Act, 5 U.S.C. \n\u00a7  7321  et  seq.,  and  the  Uniformed  Services  Employment  and  Reemployment  Rights  Act \n(\u201cUSERRA\u201d), 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4301\u201335 et seq., along with certain withholdings under the Freedom \nof Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552.  The Hatch Act regulates government employee \nparticipation in partisan political activities, generally prohibiting:  the use of \u201cofficial authority or \ninfluence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election\u201d; soliciting, \naccepting, or receiving political contributions from any person; running for election to a partisan \npolitical office; and engaging in partisan political activity on official duty time.  5 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 7323(a), 7324(a).  The Special Counsel is responsible for investigating complaints of prohibited \npolitical activities under the Act, id. \u00a7 1216(a)(1), and if he believes that disciplinary action is \nwarranted, he prepares a written complaint to the MSBP.  Id. \u00a7 1215(a)(1).11   \nThe OSC also has the authority to appear before the MSPB on behalf of a person who has \nbeen unable to resolve a complaint brought under the USERRA, which prohibits employment \ndiscrimination against members of the uniformed services and veterans \u201cbecause of their service \nin the uniformed services.\u201d  38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4301(a)(3), 4311, 4324.  This is the only instance in \nwhich the Special Counsel is permitted to appear on behalf of a party (not as a party himself) \nbefore the MSPB or the Federal Circuit, and in doing so, he would be serving as an advocate for \nthe servicemember or veteran, not the OSC.  Id. \u00a7 4324(a), (d).   \n \n11   Hatch Act violations carry only civil penalties, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7326, which are decided by the \nMerits System Protection Board.  \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 24 of 67\nThe OSC additionally has authority to investigate and bring disciplinary complaints for \n\u201carbitrary and capricious withholding[s] of information\u201d under FOIA, except for withholdings of \n\u201cforeign intelligence or counterintelligence information . . . specifically prohibited by law or by \nExecutive order.\u201d  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1216(a)(3), (c).     \n  Fourth, OSC is obliged by statute to make a series of reports to Congress.  In addition to \nthe individual reports the agency must make to Congress concerning credible whistleblower \nviolations, id. \u00a7 1213(e)(3)\u2013(4), the OSC must submit an \u201cannual\u201d report to Congress on its \n\u201cactivities.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1218.  The report must include, among other things, \u201cthe number, types, and \ndisposition of allegations of prohibited personnel practices filed with the Special Counsel and the \ncosts of resolving such allegations,\u201d \u201cthe number of investigations conducted,\u201d and \u201cthe number \nof stays and disciplinary actions negotiated with agencies.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1218(1)\u2013(13).  The agency must \nalso submit a report to Congress each time the OSC resolves an allegation \u201cby an agreement \nbetween an agency and an individual.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1217(b)(1).  Further, \u201con the request of any committee \nor subcommittee,\u201d the Special Counsel or his designee \u201cshall transmit to the Congress . . . by \nreport,  testimony,  or  otherwise,  information  and  the  Special  Counsel\u2019s  views  on  functions, \nresponsibilities, or other matters relating to the Office.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1217(a).  That information is also \n\u201ctransmitted concurrently to the President and any other appropriate agency in the executive \nbranch.\u201d  Id.   \nC.

Feb. 12, 2025).   \nLater that night, a day before the three-day administrative stay was set to expire, the Court \ngranted plaintiff\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order.  See Order [Dkt. # 14] (\u201cTRO Order\u201d).  \nIt ordered that \u201cuntil the Court rules on the entry of a preliminary injunction, plaintiff Hampton \nDellinger shall continue to serve as the Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel.\u201d  Id. at \n26.  The Court ordered that defendants must \u201cnot deny him access to the resources or materials of \nthat office or recognize the authority of any other person as Special Counsel.\u201d  Id.  The order also \nvacated the administrative stay entered on February 10, 2025, and denied defendants\u2019 motion to \nstay the Court\u2019s administrative stay as moot.  Id.

Id. at 27.  The Court also directed the parties to inform the Court of \ntheir positions on whether consideration of the preliminary injunction should be consolidated with \nconsideration of the merits under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2).  Id. \n   Defendants again appealed the Court\u2019s order to the D.C. Circuit, see Defs.\u2019 Notice of \nAppeal [Dkt. # 15], and they moved to stay the order pending their appeal.  See Defs.\u2019 Mot. to Stay \nthe Ct.\u2019s TRO [Dkt. # 16].  On February 13, the Court denied defendants\u2019 motion to stay.  See \nOrder [Dkt. # 19].

See Order, Dellinger v. Bessent, 25-5028 (D.C. Cir. Feb. \n15, 2025).     \n  On February 14, the parties filed a joint status report with their positions on consolidation \nwith the merits.

The order expires today and will be rendered moot with the ruling on \nthe merits. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nA.  Motion for Preliminary Injunction  \n\u201c[A] preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy, one that should not be \ngranted unless the movant, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.\u201d Mazurek v. \nArmstrong,  520  U.S.  968,  972  (1997)  (emphasis  in  original);  see  also  Munaf  v.  Geren, \n553 U.S. 674, 89\u201390 (2008). \n  As the Supreme Court explained in Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., \n555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008), when considering a motion for a preliminary injunction, the Court must \nconsider whether the movant has met its burden of demonstrating that:  (1) it \u201cis likely to succeed \non the merits\u201d;  (2) it is \u201clikely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief\u201d;  \n(3) \u201cthe balance of equities tips in [its] favor\u201d; and (4) an injunction serves the public interest.  Id.  \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 29 of 67\nFor some time, the Court of Appeals adhered to a \u201csliding-scale\u201d approach, where \u201ca strong \nshowing on one factor could make up for a weaker showing on another.\u201d  Sherley v. Sebelius, \n644 F.3d 388, 392 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  However, in Sherley, the Court explained that because the \nSupreme  Court\u2019s  decision  in  Winter \u201cseemed  to  treat  the  four  factors  as  independent \nrequirements,\u201d it had more recently \u201cread Winter at least to suggest if not to hold \u2018that a likelihood \nof success is an independent, free-standing requirement for a preliminary injunction.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 393, \nquoting Davis v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., 571 F.3d 1288, 1296 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (Kavanaugh, \nJ., concurring).   \nThe Court of Appeals has not gone further to clarify whether the sliding scale approach is \ninconsistent with Winter, and the manner in which courts should weigh the four factors \u201cremains \nan open question\u201d in this Circuit.  Aamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d 1023, 1043 (D.C. Cir. 2014). See \nalso League of Women Voters v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 7 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (\u201cBecause appellants \nsatisfy each of the four preliminary injunction factors, this case presents no occasion for the court \nto decide whether the \u2018sliding scale\u2019 approach remains valid after Winter.\u201d); Changji Esquel \nTextile Co. v. Raimondo, 40 F.4th 716, 726 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (reiterating that the Court has not yet \ndecided the issue).  \nWhatever the status of the sliding scale might be, the D.C. Circuit has ruled that a failure \nto  show  a  likelihood  of  success  on  the  merits  is  sufficient  to  defeat  a  motion  for \na preliminary injunction.  See Ark. Dairy Coop. Ass\u2019n v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Agric., 573 F.3d 815, 832 \n(D.C. Cir. 2009); Apotex, Inc. v. FDA, 449 F.3d 1249, 1253\u201354 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  As another court \nin this district has observed, \u201cabsent a substantial indication of likely success on the merits, there \nwould be no justification for the Court\u2019s intrusion into the ordinary processes of administration \nand judicial review.\u201d  Navistar, Inc. v. EPA, Civil Action No. 11-cv-449 (RLW), 2011 WL \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 30 of 67\n3743732, at *3 (D.D.C. Aug. 25, 2011) (alteration omitted), quoting Hubbard v. United States, \n496 F. Supp. 2d 194, 198 (D.D.C. 2007). \nAnd regardless of whether the sliding scale framework applies, it remains the law in this \nCircuit that a movant must demonstrate irreparable harm, which has \u201calways\u201d been a \u201cbasis of \ninjunctive  relief  in  the  federal  courts.\u201d   Sampson  v.  Murray,  415  U.S.  61,  88  (1974), \nquoting Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500, 506\u201307 (1959).  A failure to show \nirreparable harm is grounds for the Court to refuse to issue an injunction, \u201ceven if the other three \nfactors entering the calculus merit such relief.\u201d  Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, \n454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006).   \nSince the motion for preliminary relief has been consolidated with consideration of the \nmerits, and since this opinion will address the merits, there is no need to assess plaintiff\u2019s \nlikelihood of success.  And the request for permanent injunctive relief, along with the ruling on \nthe merits, has obviated the balancing factors supporting interim relief.   \nB.  Motion for Summary Judgment \nSummary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as \nto any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n56(a).  The party seeking summary judgment \u201cbears the initial responsibility of informing the \ndistrict  court  of  the  basis  for  its  motion,  and  identifying  those  portions  of  the  pleadings, \ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, \nwhich it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d  Celotex Corp. v. \nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted).  To defeat summary \njudgment, the non-moving party must \u201cdesignate specific facts showing that there is a genuine \nissue for trial.\u201d  Id. at 324 (internal quotation marks omitted).   \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 31 of 67\nThe mere existence of a factual dispute is insufficient to preclude summary judgment.  \nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247\u201348 (1986).  A dispute is \u201cgenuine\u201d only if a \nreasonable fact-finder could find for the non-moving party; a fact is \u201cmaterial\u201d only if it is capable \nof affecting the outcome of the litigation.  Id. at 248; Laningham v. U.S. Navy, 813 F.2d 1236, \n1241 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  In assessing a party\u2019s motion, the court must \u201cview the facts and draw \nreasonable inferences \u2018in the light most favorable to the party opposing the summary judgment \nmotion.\u2019\u201d  Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 378 (2007) (alterations omitted), quoting United States \nv. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655 (1962) (per curiam). \n\u201cThe rule governing cross-motions for summary judgment . . . is that neither party waives \nthe right to a full trial on the merits by filing its own motion; each side concedes that no material \nfacts are at issue only for the purposes of its own motion.\u201d  Sherwood v. Wash. Post, 871 F.2d 1144, \n1147 n.4 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (alteration in original), quoting McKenzie v. Sawyer, 684 F.2d 62, 68 \nn.3 (D.C. Cir. 1982).  In assessing each party\u2019s motion, \u201c[a]ll underlying facts and inferences are \nanalyzed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d  N.S. ex rel. Stein v. District of \nColumbia, 709 F. Supp. 2d 57, 65 (D.D.C. 2010), citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 247. \nC.  Motion for Permanent Injunction \nGiven the procedural posture of the case, the Court must apply the standard for the issuance \nof a permanent injunction. \nA plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction must demonstrate that:  (1) he has suffered an \nirreparable injury;  (2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate \nto compensate for that injury;  (3) considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and \ndefendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) the public interest would not be disserved by \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 32 of 67\na permanent injunction.  Monsanto Co. v. Geerston Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139, 156\u201357 (2010), \nquoting eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, LLC, 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006).   \nANALYSIS \nI.  The Court will grant summary judgment in favor of plaintiff on Count One. \n \nA.  The purported termination of the Special Counsel without cause violates \n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b). \n \nCount One of the complaint alleges that plaintiff\u2019s removal was ultra vires in violation of \n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b).  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 37\u201341.  \nAs a \u201cweapon in the arsenal for attacking federal administrative action,\u201d an ultra vires claim \nrequires the Court to determine whether defendants \u201cplainly act[ed] in excess of [their] delegated \npowers and contrary to a specific prohibition in the statute that is clear and mandatory.\u201d  Fed. \nExpress Corp. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Commerce, 39 F.4th 756, 763 (D.C. Cir. 2022).  The statutory \nmandate at issue is section 1211(b), which reads: \nThe Special Counsel shall be appointed by the President, by and with the \nadvice and consent of the Senate, for a term of 5 years . . . .  The Special \nCounsel shall be an attorney who, by demonstrated ability, background, \ntraining, or experience, is especially qualified to carry out the functions of \nthe position . . . .  The Special Counsel may be removed by the President \nonly for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.  \n \n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b).  \n  There is no genuine dispute of fact that would preclude a finding that plaintiff\u2019s removal \nwas contrary to section 1211(b).  See Defs.\u2019 Statement of Undisputed Material Facts [Dkt. # 22-2] \n(\u201cDefs.\u2019 SOF\u201d); Pl.\u2019s Statement of Material Facts Not in Genuine Dispute [Dkt. # 23-1] (\u201cPl.\u2019s \nSOF\u201d).  The parties agree that, in accordance with the statute, plaintiff was nominated by the \nPresident and confirmed by the Senate to be Special Counsel.  Defs.\u2019 SOF \u00b6 1; Pl.\u2019s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 1\u20132.  \nThe parties also agree that on February 7, plaintiff received an email from Sergio Gor, Assistant \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 33 of 67\nto the President, Director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, saying nothing more \nthan his \u201cposition as Special Counsel of the US Office of Special Counsel is terminated, effectively \nimmediately.\u201d  Defs.\u2019 SOF \u00b6 2; Pl.\u2019s SOF \u00b6 5; Ex. A.  The email did not identify a reason, and it \ndid not assert that plaintiff was being removed for \u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance \nin office.\u201d  Nor have defendants asserted since then that he was terminated for one of those reasons \nor any other.  Having been sworn into office on March 6, 2024, section 1211(b) required plaintiff \nto serve his five-year term until March 2029 unless the President removed him \u201cfor inefficiency, \nneglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b).  So, the undisputed facts show that \nthe purported termination contravened section 1211(b), and therefore the Court finds that it was \nan ultra vires action.     \nB.  The  statutory  term  of  five  years,  protected  by  the  removal  for  cause \nprovision, is not unconstitutional. \n1.  Neither Seila Law or Collins compel the conclusion that section 1211(b) \nis unconstitutional. \nDefendants\u2019  only  response  to  this  reading  of  the  plain  text  is  that  the  statute  is \nunconstitutional.  Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 6\u201315.  But no court has reached that conclusion. Instead, the \nSupreme Court made it a point to carve the OSC out of its pronouncements concerning the \nPresident\u2019s Article II prerogative to have unrestricted control over who should assist him in \ndischarging his responsibilities.  \n  In their motion for summary judgment, defendants paint with a broad brush: \n \nIn the last five years, the Supreme Court has twice held that restrictions on \nthe President\u2019s authority to remove principal officers who serve as the sole \nheads of executive agencies violate Article II\u2014in those cases, the single \nheads  of  the  Consumer  Financial  Protection  Bureau  and  the  Federal \nHousing Finance Agency. . . .  Whatever the agency, for the President to \ndischarge his constitutional duty to supervise those who exercise executive \npower on his behalf, the President can \u201cremove the head of an agency with \na single top officer\u201d at will.  \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 34 of 67\n \nDefs.\u2019 Mot. at 1, citing Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020) and Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. \n220, 256 (2021). 14  But that is an oversimplified and inaccurate summary of the authority that \nguides the determination to be made, and the Supreme Court, in deciding the particular cases \nbefore it, did not announced a blanket rule that governs \u201cwhatever the agency.\u201d  To the contrary, \nin both Seila Law and Collins, the Court went into great detail about the individual agencies at \nissue, and the reasoning underlying those decisions does not apply to the case at hand.15 \n \n14   The Court addressed both Seila Law and Collins in its February 12 Temporary Restraining \nOrder.  TRO Order at 9\u201315.   \n \n15    Defendants also cite Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593 (2024), for the proposition that \n\u201cthe President\u2019s power to remove executive officers of the United States whom he has appointed \nmay not be regulated by Congress or reviewed by the courts.\u201d Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 7 (internal quotations \nomitted).  But this lifts a single phrase far out of the context of a case that has nothing to do with \nthe questions raised here.  In Trump, the Court considered whether allegations in the indictment \nagainst Donald Trump concerning threats he allegedly made to replace the Acting Attorney \nGeneral, during discussions with Justice Department officials after the 2020 election, implicated \nthe use of his official authority such that he would be absolutely immune from prosecution for the \nalleged conduct.  Id. at 602\u201303, 617.  As part of that particular analysis, the Court observed:  \n \nInvestigative and prosecutorial decisionmaking is \u201cthe special province of \nthe Executive Branch,\u201d Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 832 (1985), and \nthe Constitution vests the entirety of the executive power in the President, \nArt. II, \u00a7 1.  For that reason, Trump\u2019s threatened removal of the Acting \nAttorney  General  likewise  implicates  \u201cconclusive  and  preclusive\u201d \nPresidential authority.  As we have explained, the President\u2019s power to \nremove \u201cexecutive officers of the United States whom he has appointed\u201d \nmay  not  be  regulated  by  Congress  or  reviewed  by  the  courts.    The \nPresident\u2019s \u201cmanagement of the Executive Branch\u201d requires him to have \n\u201cunrestricted power to remove the most important of his subordinates\u201d\u2014\nsuch as the Attorney General\u2014\u201cin their most important duties.\u201d \n \nId. at 620\u201321, citing Myers, 272 U.S. at 106, 176, and Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731, 750 \n(internal citations omitted).  While the Heckler proposition is well-established, this discussion is \ninapposite here because it turned upon the enforcement of criminal laws, the \u201cquintessentially \nexecutive function\u201d over which the executive branch has \u201cexclusive and absolute discretion.\u201d  That \nis not the situation here.  The Special Counsel\u2019s role is not analogous to (continued on next page)  \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 35 of 67\n  In Seila Law, the question arose when a law firm resisting a civil investigative demand \nissued by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) challenged the legitimacy of the \nagency\u2019s structure.  591 U.S. at 208.  To address that contention, the Court began by reviewing its \nopinions on the President\u2019s power to remove executive branch officials.  It pointed to its decision \nin Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926), which held that Article II accords the President the \n\u201cgeneral administrative control of those executing the laws, including the power of appointment \nand removal of executive officers.\u201d  Id. at 163\u201364.  The Seila Law opinion also included the \nreminder that in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, 561 U.S. \n477 (2010), the Court reaffirmed that \u201cas a general matter, the Constitution gives the President the \nauthority to remove those who assist him in carrying out his duties.\u201d Seila Law 591 U.S. at 204, \nciting Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 513\u201314.  \nSeila Law also discussed the Court\u2019s later opinion in Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. United States, \n295 U.S. 602 (1935), which let restrictions on removal of the members of the New Deal-era FTC, \nas it was constituted in 1935, stand.16  It emphasized that \u201c[w]hile recognizing an exception for \nmulti-member bodies with \u2018quasi-judicial\u2019 or \u2018quasi-legislative\u2019 functions, Humphrey\u2019s Executor \nreaffirmed the core holding of Myers that the President has \u2018unrestrictable power . . . to remove \npurely executive officers.\u2019\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 217.  But it noted that the Humphrey\u2019s Executor \ncourt also \u201cacknowledged that between purely executive officers on the one hand, and officers that \n \nthat of the leaders of the United States Department of Justice, who are among \u201cthe most important\u201d \nof the President\u2019s \u201csubordinates.\u201d \n \n16   The  Court  notes  that  this  ruling  does  not  depend  upon  the  continuing  vitality  of \nHumphrey\u2019s Executor.  It is included here since it was part of the discussion in Seila Law, but it \ndealt with multi-member entities and not an organization with a single head like the OSC.  \nHumphrey\u2019s Executor, 295 U.S. at 619. \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 36 of 67\nclosely resembled the FTC Commissioners on the other, there existed \u2018a field of doubt\u2019 that the \nCourt left for \u2018future consideration.\u2019\u201d  Id., citing Humphrey\u2019s Executor, 295 U.S. at 632.  And \n\u201c[b]ecause the Court limited its holding to \u2018officers of the kind here under consideration,\u2019 . . . the \ncontours of the Humphrey\u2019s Executor exception depend upon the characteristics of the agency \nbefore the Court.\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 215, quoting Humphrey\u2019s Executor, 295 U.S. at 632. \nSeila Law also summarized the decision in Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988), \nconcerning an \u201cindependent counsel,\u201d who was appointed under the now-expired Independent \nCounsel Reauthorization Act of 1994,17 to investigate whether a particular high-ranking official \nhad committed a crime.  Morrison, 487 U.S. at 660.  The quasi-legislative, quasi-judicial paradigm \nwas not applicable, so the Court \u201cviewed the ultimate question as whether a removal restriction is \nof \u2018such a nature that it impedes the President\u2019s ability to perform his constitutional duty.\u2019\u201d  Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 217, quoting Morrison, 487 U.S. at 691. And while the independent counsel was \nspecifically charged with performing law enforcement functions typically reserved to the executive \nbranch \u2013 in particular, investigating and prosecuting crimes \u2013 the Court \u201cconcluded that the \nremoval protections did not unduly interfere with the functioning of the Executive branch because \n\u2018the independent counsel was an inferior officer under the Appointments Clause, with limited \njurisdiction and tenure and lacking policymaking or significant administrative authority.\u2019\u201d Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 217\u201318 (alterations omitted). \nThe Seila Law opinion characterized the two limited exceptions that had been recognized \nto date \u2013 \u201cone for multimember expert agencies that do not wield substantial executive power, and \none for inferior officers with limited duties and no policymaking or administrative authority\u201d \u2013 as \n \n17   This Act expired on June 30, 1999.  See Final Rule, 64 Fed. Reg. 37,038, 37,041 (July 9, \n1999).   \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 37 of 67\n\u201cwhat up to now have been the outermost constitutional limits of permissible congressional \nrestrictions on the President\u2019s removal powers.\u201d  Id. at 218.  It then explained why neither existing \nexception applied to the CFPB.  \n  With respect to the first exception, Seila Law explained: \n[T]he CFPB Director is hardly a mere legislative or judicial aid.  Instead of \nmaking reports and recommendations to Congress, as the 1935 FTC did, the \nDirector possesses the authority to promulgate binding rules fleshing out 19 \nfederal statutes, including a broad prohibition on unfair and deceptive \npractices  in  a  major  segment  of  the  U.S.  economy.   And  instead  of \nsubmitting recommended dispositions to an Article III court, the Director \nmay unilaterally issue final decisions awarding legal and equitable relief in \nadministrative adjudications.  Finally, the Director's enforcement authority \nincludes the power to seek daunting monetary penalties against private \nparties on behalf of the United States in federal court\u2014a quintessentially \nexecutive power not considered in Humphrey\u2019s Executor.   \n \nId. at 218\u201319.  The Court also highlighted the fact that the CFPB director \u201ccannot be considered \nnon-partisan . . . .\u201d  Id. at 218. \n  As for the comparison to Morrison, there was no question that the CFPB Director was not \nan inferior officer, and she could not be likened to an independent counsel, who, while empowered \nto carry out a core executive function, lacked policy making or administrative authority.  \n[T]he  Director  has  the  sole  responsibility  to  administer  19  separate \nconsumer-protection statutes that cover everything from credit cards and car \npayments to mortgages and student loans.  It is true that the independent \ncounsel in Morrison was empowered to initiate criminal investigations and \nprosecutions, and in that respect wielded core executive power.  But that \npower, while significant, was trained inward to high-ranking Governmental \nactors identified by others, and was confined to a specified matter in which \nthe Department of Justice had a potential conflict of interest.  By contrast, \nthe CFPB Director has the authority to bring the coercive power of the state \nto bear on millions of private citizens and businesses, imposing even billion-\ndollar penalties through administrative adjudications and civil actions \n \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 38 of 67\nId. at 219\u201320.18 \n \n  Since the constitutionality of the provision protecting the CFPB Director could not be \ndecided by invoking either Morrison or Humphrey\u2019s Executor, the Supreme Court framed the \nquestion before it in Seila Law as whether to extend those precedents to the new sort of executive \nagency before it: \u201can independent agency led by a single Director and vested with significant \nexecutive power.\u201d  Id. at 220.  Since to the Court, a lack of historical precedent for such an agency \ncould be potential sign of constitutional problems, it then considered what precedent there was, \nand it pointed out that there were only four isolated examples, and they \u201cshed little light\u201d on what \nto do about the Director of the CFPB.  Id.  \n  One of the four was the Office of Special Counsel.  Id. at 221.  And while the Court recited \nsome of the historical background detailed above \u2013 that the first attempt to create such a position \ndrew an objection from the Office of Legal Counsel under President Carter, and another prior \nversion of the statute was vetoed on constitutional grounds by President Reagan \u2013 it went on to \ndistinguish the OSC from the CFPB: \n[T]he  OSC  exercises  only  limited  jurisdiction to  enforce  certain  rules \ngoverning Federal Government employers and employees.  See 5 U.S.C. \n\u00a71212.  It does not bind private parties at all or wield regulatory authority \ncomparable to the CFPB. \n \n18   Plaintiff argues that Seila Law does not control his case because he falls within the \nexception for inferior officers.  Pl\u2019s Mot. at 11\u201314; see Pl.\u2019s Reply at 1\u20133.  The Court need not find \nthat Dellinger is an inferior officer in order to distinguish Seila Law, and it is not persuaded that \nthe characterization is accurate.  While the Supreme Court has not established a bright-line rule or \nclearly defined test to distinguish between principal and inferior officers, see Edmond v. United \nStates, 520 U.S. 651, 661 (1997); Morrison, 487 U.S. at 671, it has  identified a set of factors to \ninform the determination:  (1) the existence (and identity) of a superior with removal power;  (2) \nthe scope of the officer\u2019s duties;  (3) the scope of the officer\u2019s authority and jurisdiction; and (4) \nand the nature of the officer\u2019s tenure.  See Edmond, 520 U.S. at 661\u201363.  And in light of the first \nfactor, the fact that the President has the authority to remove the Special Counsel for cause appears \nto answer the question.  Moreover, he is a Presidential appointee who must be confirmed by the \nSenate under the Appointments Clause.  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b).   \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 39 of 67\n \nId. at 221; see also id. at 222 (The OSC and two other single-headed agencies \u201cdo not involve \nregulatory or enforcement authority remotely comparable to that exercised by the CFBP.\u201d). \nThe only conclusion one can draw from this discussion is that this case is distinguishable \nfrom Seila Law.  It would be entirely inconsistent and illogical to read the Supreme Court\u2019s \ndescription of the OSC as \u201cnot remotely comparable\u201d to the CFPB, and so distinct that a \nconsideration of its statutory scheme does nothing to illuminate the constitutionality of the CFPB \nstatute, and then maintain that the Seila Law decision invalidating the removal protections in that \nstatute governs the OSC as well.   \nA close review of the statutory scheme at issue confirms that the OSC does not belong in \nthe category of \u201can independent agency led by a single Director and vested with significant \nexecutive power.\u201d  Id. at 220.  Therefore, adherence to the principles and reasoning in Seila Law \nrequires a different outcome in this case.  \nPlaintiff and defendants direct the Court to the same section of the statute, but while it \ncontains some executive-sounding verbs, there is a striking absence of teeth and authority behind \nthem.  The statute provides: \nThe Office of Special Counsel shall . . . receive and investigate allegations \nof prohibited personnel practices, and, where appropriate . . . bring petitions \nfor stays, and petitions for corrective action, . . . and file a complaint or \nmake recommendations for disciplinary action.   \n \n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1212(a)(2)(A), (B); see id. \u00a7 1214(b)(2)(B)\u2013(C) (petition for corrective action); \nid. \u00a7 1215(a)(1)(A)\u2013(C) (complaint for disciplinary action).  While the Special Counsel may \n\u201cconduct  an investigation\u201d to  determine  whether there  are reasonable  grounds to  believe  a \nprohibited personnel practice has occurred, id. \u00a7 1214(a)(5), he may not demand corrective action, \nhe must \u201cpetition\u201d the Merit Systems Protection Board and ask it to order it. \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 40 of 67\nThe  Board  shall  order  such  corrective  action  as  the  Board  considers \nappropriate,  if  the  Board  determines  that  the  Special  Counsel  has \ndemonstrated that a prohibited personnel practice . . . has occurred, exists, \nor is to be taken . . . . [T]he Board shall order such corrective action as the \nBoard considers appropriate if the Special Counsel has demonstrated that a \ndisclosure  or  protected  activity . . . was  a  contributing  factor  in  the \npersonnel action which was taken or is to be taken against the individual.  \n \nId. \u00a7 1214(b)(4)(A)\u2013(B)(i).  The authority rests with the Board, then, to do what it considers \nappropriate.  See Am. Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Emps., AFL-CIO v. O\u2019Connor, 747 F. 2d 748, 753 (D.C. Cir \n1984) (\u201c[T]he MSPB is free to disagree with the Special Counsel and often does.\u201d).  And if the \nSpecial Counsel is recommending disciplinary action against \u201can employee in a confidential, \npolicy-making, policy-determining, or policy-advocating position appointed by the President, by \nand with the advice of the Senate,\u201d the complaint must be presented to the President for appropriate \naction, not the MSPB.  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1215(b).  Again, it\u2019s not up to the Special Counsel; the President \nhas the last word. \n While like the Director of the CFPB, the Special Counsel plays a role in enforcing a \nnumber of separate statutory imperatives, the responsibility does not rest with him alone.  \nThe Special counsel may investigate allegations of violations of the Hatch Act as a more \ntypical law enforcement officer might do, id. \u00a7 1216(a), but if he finds that any of the enumerated \nconduct has occurred, he is only authorized to \u201cseek\u201d corrective action in the same manner as if a \nprohibited personnel practice was involved.  Id. \u00a7 1216(c).  The Special Counsel is authorized to \nhave access to the records of other agencies that are applicable to an inquiry he is conducting.  Id. \n\u00a7 1212(b)(5)(A).  But an Inspector General may withhold material if it contains information \npertaining to  intelligence activities, and the Attorney General  or an Inspector General  may \nwithhold  it  if  disclosure  could  interfere  with  an  ongoing  criminal  investigation.  Id. \n\u00a7 1212(b)(5)(B). \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 41 of 67\nWhen it comes to whistleblower protections, while one may generally characterize the \nOSC\u2019s role as \u201cenforcing\u201d the rules against reprisals, the statute directs that the office shall \n\u201creceive, review, and where appropriate, forward to the Attorney General or an agency head\u201d \ndisclosures of violations of criminal conduct, the gross waste of funds, abuse of authority, or danger \nto public health or safety.  Id. \u00a7 1212(a)(3).  He is a conduit.  See id. \u00a7 1213(b), (c)(1)(A)\u2013(B), \n(f)(1)\u2013(2). \nEven if his review of disclosures leads him to determine that there is a substantial likelihood \nthat specifically identified forms of wrongdoing have occurred, his job is to \u201cpromptly transmit\u201d \nthe information to the appropriate agency head and write a report.  Id. \u00a7 1213(b), (c)(1)(A)\u2013(B).  \n \nThe rest of the Seila Law opinion points to constitutional concerns with the configuration \nof the CFPB that do not translate easily to the OSC.  It found that the CFPB\u2019s structure contravened \nthe Framers\u2019 insistence on a strong executive, which has been embodied in Article II.  But on what \nbasis? \nThe CFPB\u2019s single-Director structure contravenes this carefully calibrated \nsystem by vesting significant governmental power in the hands of a single \nindividual accountable to no one. The Director is neither elected by the \npeople nor meaningfully controlled (through the threat of removal) by \nsomeone who is . . . .  Yet the director may unilaterally, without meaningful \nsupervision, issue final regulations, oversee adjudications, set enforcement \npriorities, initiate prosecutions, and determine what penalties to impose on \nprivate parties. With no colleagues to persuade, and no boss to electorate \nlooking over her shoulder, the Director may direct and enforce policy for a \nvital segment of the economy affecting millions of Americans. \n \nSeila Law, 591 U.S. at 224\u201325 (emphasis in original).  If those circumstances were important to \nthe  determination  that  the  removal  restrictions  applicable  to  the  CFPB  Director  were \nunconstitutional, it is telling that the Special Counsel cannot do much of anything unilaterally.  He \ndoes not issue final regulations, oversee adjudications, initiate prosecutions, or determine what \npenalties to impose on private parties.  He most certainly does not \u201cdirect and enforce policy for a \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 42 of 67\nvital segment of the economy affecting millions of Americans;\u201d he does not even \u201cdirect policy\u201d \naffecting the civil servants within his purview. \n  If one adopts the approach utilized in Seila Law and applies the criteria that were persuasive \nin that case, it becomes clear that the Special Counsel falls well within the \u201cfield of doubt\u201d \nHumphrey\u2019s Executor left for another day and outside the reach of Seila Law.  While he concedes \nthat he performs \u201csome\u201d executive functions, he cannot be described as a \u201cpurely executive \nofficer.\u201d  Nor does he \u201cwield significant executive powers,\u201d and unlike any of the agency heads \nthat have been the subject of Supreme Court consideration in the past, his role can hardly even be \ncharacterized as assisting the President in carrying out his duties.   \nThe defendants repeat the mantra that he \u201cinvestigates and prosecutes,\u201d but this effort to \nconjure up the image of a United States Attorney striding into court with the power to hold people \naccountable for their crimes is not an apt comparison.  The Special Counsel has a much more \nrestricted role.  While he is authorized to investigate certain forms of wrongdoing, he lacks real \nprosecutorial authority: his charter is to ensure that the rules of the federal workplace are followed, \nbut if an investigation reveals wrongdoing, he has to recommend that some other quasi-judicial or \nadministrative agency do something about it.  His tools are not grand juries or federal indictments; \nthe proceedings he seeks to initiate are civil, and not even civil actions in an Article III court, but \nonly complaints to be heard by an administrative agency, which can decline to pursue them.  He \ncan issue subpoenas to advance his investigation, but he cannot enforce them in court.  He has to \nask the MSPB to do that too.  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1212(b)(3)(A), (B).  He can review and recommend \nagency regulations, but he has no policymaking authority if his suggestions fall on deaf ears.  Id. \n\u00a7 1212(a)(4).  If he is concerned that any Office of Personnel Management rule would require the \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 43 of 67\ncommission of a prohibited personnel practice, he must file a complaint with the MSPB.  Id. \n\u00a7 1212(a)(4).   \n  Defendants quote the Supreme Court\u2019s comment about the head of the CFPB: \u201c[w]ith no \ncolleagues to persuade, and no boss or electorate looking over her shoulder,\u201d the Director could \n\u201cunilaterally\u201d \u201cdictate and enforce policy.\u201d  Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 8, quoting Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 225.  \nBut this selection from Seila Law demonstrates exactly why the cases are not analogous.  Unlike \nthe head of the CFPB, the Special Counsel has no authority to \u201cdictate\u201d policy, and for the most \npart, he cannot enforce it unilaterally either.  He must refer matters to the MSPB or make \nrecommendations to other agencies.  Moreover, since he stands alone, outside of the vast corps of \nofficials who actually \u201cassist [the President] in carrying out his duties,\u201d Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 204, \nciting Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 513\u201314, the restrictions on his removal do not conflict with \nthe general principles announced in Myers and Free Enterprise Fund. \nAlthough this Court does not consider plaintiff to be an inferior officer, the case is more \nakin to Morrison, in which the Court found that the removal protections did not unduly interfere \nwith the functioning of the executive branch because, in part, the independent counsel had \u201climited \njurisdiction and tenure and lacked policymaking or significant administrative authority.\u201d  Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 217, quoting Morrison, 487 U.S. at 691.  If, as in that case, one considers the \nquestion posed by the Supreme Court \u2013 \u201cwhether a removal restriction is of such a nature that it \nimpedes the President\u2019s ability to perform his constitutional duty\u201d \u2013 the answer is no. \nFor all of these reasons, it appears to the Court that the removal restriction comports with \nSeila Law. \n  The decision in Collins v. Yellen does not require the invalidation of section 1211(b) either.\n  Collins  was  an  action  brought  by  shareholders  of  the  Federal  National  Mortgage \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 44 of 67\nAssociation (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\u201cFreddie Mac\u201d) \nagainst the Federal Housing Finance Agency (\u201cFHFA\u201d).  594 U.S. at 235.  Like  the  CFPB,  the \nFHFA was established by Congress in the wake of the financial crisis in 2008, and it was authorized \nto oversee Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and to serve as a conservator or receiver if necessary, as \nboth had suffered significant losses due to the collapse of the housing market.  Id. at 226.  The \nshareholders  challenged  actions  taken  by  the  FHFA  in  its  role  as  conservator  and  the \nconstitutionality of the agency\u2019s structure.  An amicus was appointed to present arguments on \nbehalf of the agency head.  Id. at 236.  The Court held that the shareholders\u2019 claim was barred by \nHousing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, 12 U.S.C. \u00a74627(f), but it addressed the separation \nof powers issue.   \nDefendants quote snippets from the ruling, but it is necessary to review the opinion as a \nwhole to understand what they mean.  Before reaching the merits, the Court detailed the wide-\nranging powers of the agency: \nThe  Agency  is  tasked  with  supervising  nearly  every  aspect  of  the \ncompanies\u2019 management and operations. For example, the Agency must \napprove any new products that the companies would like to offer. \u00a7 4541(a). \nIt may reject acquisitions and certain transfers of interests the companies \nseek  to  execute.  \u00a7  4513(a)(2)(A).  It  establishes  criteria  governing  the \ncompanies\u2019 portfolio holdings. \u00a7 4624(a). It may order the companies to \ndispose of or acquire any asset. \u00a7 4624(c). It may impose caps on how much \nthe companies compensate their executives and prohibit or limit golden \nparachute  and  indemnification  payments.  \u00a7  4518.  It  may  require  the \ncompanies  to  submit  regular  reports  on  their  condition  or  \u201cany  other \nrelevant topics.\u201d \u00a7 4514(a)(2). And it must conduct one on-site examination \nof the companies each year and may, on any terms the Director deems \nappropriate, hire outside firms to perform additional reviews. \u00a7\u00a7 4517(a)\u2013\n(b), 4519.  \n \nId. at 230. \nThe statute empowers the Agency with broad investigative and enforcement \nauthority to ensure compliance with these standards. Among other things, \nthe  Agency  may  hold  hearings,  \u00a7\u00a7  4582,  4633;  issue  subpoenas, \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 45 of 67\n\u00a7\u00a7 4588(a)(3), 4641(a)(3); remove or suspend corporate officers, \u00a7 4636a; \nissue cease-and-desist orders, \u00a7\u00a7 4581, 4632; bring civil actions in federal \ncourt, \u00a7\u00a7 4584, 4635; and impose penalties ranging from $2,000 to $2 \nmillion per day, \u00a7\u00a7 4514(c)(2), 4585, 4636(b).  \nId. \n \nThe Recovery Act grants the FHFA expansive authority in its role as a \nconservator. As we have explained, the Agency is authorized to take control \nof a regulated entity\u2019s assets and operations, conduct business on its behalf, \nand transfer or sell any of its assets or liabilities. See \u00a7\u00a7 4617(b)(2)(B)\u2013(C), \n(G).   \n \nId. at 238\u201339. \n \nOnce it addressed whether the shareholders had standing to raise the constitutional issues, \nid. at 242\u201343, and that the removal restrictions at issue applied to the Director, but not the Acting \nDirector, id. at 250, the Collins opinion started with the proposition that the decision in Seila Law \nwas \u201call but dispositive.\u201d  Id.  The Court did not propose that it was necessary to revisit the analysis \nundertaken in the prior term; nor did it find it necessary to overturn any aspect of Seila Law or any \nof the authority upon which Seila Law was founded.  It stated that \u201c[a] straightforward application \nof our reasoning in Seila Law dictates the result here.\u201d  Collins, 594 U.S. at 251. \nThe opinion then considered each of the four arguments raised by the amicus in an effort \nto distinguish Seila Law, and it concluded that none of them was sufficient to call for a different \nresult.  First, the Court rebuffed the contention that Congress should have greater flexibility to \nrestrict the President\u2019s power to remove the FHFA director because the agency\u2019s authority is more \nlimited than that of the CFPB.  See Collins, 594 U.S. at 251.  It stated that \u201cthe nature and breadth \nof the agency\u2019s authority is not dispositive,\u201d and it elaborated on what it meant: \nThe President\u2019s removal power serves vital purposes even when the officer \nsubject to removal is not the head of one of the largest and most powerful \nagencies. The removal power helps the President maintain a degree of \ncontrol over the subordinates he needs to carry out his duties as the head of \nthe Executive Branch, and it works to ensure that these subordinates serve \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 46 of 67\nthe people effectively and in accordance with the policies that the people \npresumably elected the  President to  promote . . . .  These purposes are \nimplicated whenever an agency does important work, and nothing about the \nsize or role of the FHFA convinces us that its Director should be treated \ndifferently from the Director of the CFPB.  \n \nId. at 252; see also id. at 253 (\u201c[W]hile the CFPB has direct regulatory and enforcement authority \nover purely private individuals and businesses, the FHFA has regulatory and enforcement authority \nover two companies that dominate the secondary mortgage market and have the power to reshape \nthe housing sector . . . .  FHFA actions with respect to those companies could have an immediate \nimpact on millions of private individuals and the economy at large.\u201d).  In short, the Court again \napplied the Seila Law principles to an agency that did in fact \u201cwield significant executive power.\u201d \nThe objective of these principles was to \u201censure that the President\u2019s subordinates serve the people \neffectively and in accordance with the policies that the people presumably elected the President to \npromote.\u201d  Id. at 252.  But as it has just been explained, that is not the Special Counsel\u2019s job.  He \npresents information to the President and can make recommendations to the President, but he is \nnot tasked with carrying his executive agenda. \nThe  Court  further  observed  that  \u201c[c]ourts  are  not  well-suited  to  weigh  the  relative \nimportance of the regulatory and enforcement authority of disparate agencies, and we do not think \nthat the constitutionality of removal restrictions hinges on such an inquiry.\u201d  Id. at 253. \nNext, the amicus posited that when the agency was acting as a conservator, it was \neffectively assuming the status of a private party and not exercising executive power.  Id. at \n253\u201354.  The court rejected that on the grounds that the agency does not always act as a \n \nconservator, and that even in that role, it is implementing a statutory scheme that accords it powers \nand responsibilities that ordinary conservators lack.  Id. at 254.  The Court did observe, though, \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 47 of 67\nthat interpreting a law passed by Congress in an effort to implement it is, by definition, the \n\u201c\u2018execution\u2019 of the law.\u201d  Id., quoting Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 733 (1986). \nThird, the amicus maintained that the structure of the agency did not offend Article II \nbecause the regulated entities were \u201c[g]overnment-sponsored enterprises that have federal charters, \nserve public objectives, and receive special privileges like tax exemptions and certain borrowing \nrights.\u201d  Collins, 594 U.S. at 255 (internal quotations omitted).  The contention was that the \nconcerns underlying the limitations on removal power were inapplicable when the regulated bodies \nwere not purely private actors.  Id.   This, too, was found to be unpersuasive because \u201cthe \nPresident\u2019s removal power serves important purposes regardless of whether the agency in question \naffects ordinary Americans by directly regulating them or by taking actions that have a profound \nbut indirect effect on their lives.\u201d  Id. \n   The fourth argument was that the five-year tenure provided only \u201cmodest\u201d protection, as \nthe Director could be fired under the existing provisions for disobeying a lawful Presidential order. \nId. at 255\u201356.  The Court responded that even modest restrictions on the President\u2019s power are \nprohibited.  Id. at 256.  And it emphasized that, in its view, the President must be able to remove \nnot only officers who disobey his commands and who are negligent or inefficient, but \u201cthose who \nexercise their discretion in a way that is not intelligent or wise, those who have different views of \npolicy, and those who come from a competing political party who is dead set against the President\u2019s \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 48 of 67\nagenda, and those in whom he has simply lost confidence.\u201d  Id. at 256 (internal quotation marks \nand citations omitted).19  \nBut the plaintiff is not relying on any of those contentions.  His point is not that his agency \nis smaller or that his regulatory and enforcement authority is less important.  He does not hang his \nhat on the fact that his term is \u201conly\u201d for five years.  He does not deny that he has some executive \nresponsibilities \u2013 after all, the Seila Law test is not whether the official exercises any executive \npower.  His point is that at bottom, while he has some executive-like functions, and that carrying \nout his duties of course entails \u201cexecuting\u201d the statute that established the position, he does not \nwield  significant  executive  power  because  he  lacks  real  ability  to  exercise  regulatory  or \nenforcement authority or decision-making; in almost every situation he encounters, the buck does \nnot  stop  with  him.    He  is,  primarily,  an  ombudsman  who  looks  into  complaints  and \n \n19   In a footnote in Collins, the Court addressed the warning by the amicus that a holding \nstriking down the removal restrictions in the Recovery Act could affect other agencies as well, \nnaming the Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d) and the Office of Special Counsel, among \nothers.  594 U.S. at 256, n. 21.  The Court observed that those agencies were not before it and \nchose not to comment on the constitutionality of any similar provisions that applied to them.  Id. \nAfter Collins was decided, the Office of Legal Counsel issued an opinion concluding that the \ndecisions in Seila Law and Collins necessitated a finding that the protections against removing the \nSSA Commissioner were unconstitutional.  Constitutionality of the Commissioner of Social \nSecurity\u2019s Tenure Protection, 45 Op. O.L.C. __, 1 (O.L.C. July 8, 2021).  But the OLC included \nan explicit caveat that this vindication of the President\u2019s Article II powers by the President\u2019s own \nlegal advisors did not necessarily extend to the Office of Special Counsel.  See id. at 10 n.3 (\u201cThis \nopinion does not address the validity of tenure protections conferred on the Special Counsel, whose \nremoval restrictions implicate different considerations . . . .\u201d).  Like the Supreme Court in Seila \nLaw, the opinion contrasted the SSA\u2019s impact on a large segment of the public, enormous budget, \nand  exceptionally  broad  rulemaking  authority  with  the  OSC\u2019s  ability  to  do  no  more  than \nrecommend regulatory changes.  Id. at 15, citing Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 217\u201318 (\u201cWe emphasize \nthe limited scope of our conclusion regarding the [SSA] Commissioner. It does not imply any \nsimilar determination with respect to the validity of tenure protections conferred on other executive \nofficials \u2013 for example, the Special Counsel, another single member agency head whose removal \nrestrictions implicate different considerations, such as the Special Counsel\u2019s primary investigative \nfunction and \u2018limited jurisdiction.\u2019\u201d).  \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 49 of 67\nallegations \u2013 albeit with subpoena authority \u2013 and recommends that others, who do exercise \nexecutive or quasi-judicial authority, take action based on his findings.  And the OSC does not \neither \u201caffect ordinary Americans by directly regulating them or by taking actions that have a \nprofound but indirect effect on their lives.\u201d  Collins, 594 U.S. at 255 (emphasis added). \nPlaintiff does not invite the Court to weigh the relative importance of various agencies\u2019 \ncharters, as Collins said it shouldn\u2019t; the reason Seila Law is distinguishable is not because the \nagency is smaller or less important.  It is because that, while the OSC is bound to implement the \nstatutory directives imposed by Congress, it cannot fairly be likened to a typical administrative \nagency charged with implementing those directives in accordance with Presidential policy and \npriorities.  The Special Counsel is supposed to withstand the winds of political change and help \nensure that no government servant of either party becomes the subject of prohibited employment \npractices  or  faces  reprisals  for  calling  out  wrongdoing  \u2013  by  holdovers  from  a  previous \nadministration or by officials of the new one.20   \nIf Seila Law is to control a case involving the single head of an independent agency, as \nCollins said it should, it is essential to peek behind titles and labels and engage in this close \n \n20   Upholding the statutory restriction on removal in the absence of \u201cinefficiency, neglect of \nduty, or malfeasance in office\u201d does not give rise to the risk that a President could be stuck with a \nSpecial Counsel who is failing to fulfill the limited executive functions he does have.  Nothing in \nplaintiff\u2019s pleadings challenges the President\u2019s \u201cgeneral removal power,\u201d or the \u201cgeneral rule that \nthe President possesses \u2018the authority to remove those who assist him in carrying out his duties.\u2019\u201d \nSeila Law, 591 U.S. at 215, quoting Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 513\u201314.  Similarly, the statute \ndoes not leave the President in the situation that troubled the Court in Myers when it concluded \nthat the lack of the power to remove \u201cwould make it impossible for the President . . . to take care \nthat the laws be faithfully executed.\u201d  272 U.S. at 164.  Here, the statutory authority to remove the \nSpecial  Counsel  for  cause  enables  him  to  fulfill  that  directive,  while  also  preserving  the \nrequirement that the Special Counsel be insulated to some degree. \n \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 50 of 67\nexamination of the particular position involved.  And it is important to note that this official has a \nsignificant obligation that distinguishes him from the heads of the other agencies discussed: the \nresponsibility to report his activities and findings not just to the President, but to Congress.   \nFinally, plaintiff fully recognizes that the removal provision he seeks to enforce could, as \nthe Court in Collins warned, bar the President from dismissing him on purely political grounds. \nBut, he maintains, that\u2019s as it should be.  The agency involved in Collins was qualitatively different \nfrom the Office of Special Counsel, which was specifically designed to serve a singular function \nfor which independence from partisan political interference is necessary.  The Court agrees and \nfinds that Collins does not require the invalidation of the statutory restrictions on removing the \nSpecial Counsel.  \n2.  The  history,  purpose,  and  nature  of  the  statute  demonstrate  that \nindependence from political or partisan interference is fundamental to \nthe Special Counsel. \nIt is notable that while the Supreme Court struck down the removal restrictions in the Seila \nLaw case, it found them to be severable from the rest of the Dodd-Frank Act and left it untouched. \n591 U.S. at 234\u201335.  There was nothing about those provisions that affected the operations or \nstructure of the CFPB, id. at 235, and their absence would not prevent the agency head from \nperforming her duties.  Indeed, the Supreme Court had concluded that the opposite was true: the \npresence of the restrictions interfered with the Director\u2019s inherent obligation to perform those \nduties on behalf of the executive and the President\u2019s ability to oversee her.  Id. at 223\u201326.  \nThe instant situation is entirely different.  Excising the provisions that protect the Special \nCounsel from dismissal for partisan or arbitrary reasons would cut straight to the heart of the \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 51 of 67\nstatutory scheme: the Special Counsel\u2019s independence.  The term \u201cindependent agency\u201d is not \nsimply a label in this case; it is existential for the OSC.21    \nConsider how this all began.  President Carter proposed, and Congress created, the Special \nCounsel to protect the merits-based civil service system from \u201cimproper political influences or \npersonal favoritism,\u201d see President Carter Letter, and \u201cto protect individuals who speak out about \ngovernment wrongdoing from reprisals.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 2.  That merits-based system did \nnot always exist.  For nearly a century after the nation\u2019s founding, federal employment was plagued \nby a spoils system that permitted the President to treat a government job as an \u201citem of patronage\u201d \nto be rewarded to his partisan supporters only.  Arnett, 416 U.S. at 148.  Presidents across the \npolitical spectrum abused this power, until it resulted in the death of a sitting President, which \nspurred a movement for significant reform that would replace the patronage system entirely.     \nIn that context, it becomes clear why Congress, throughout its creation and refinement of \nthe position of Special Counsel, took pains to insulate him to some degree from the President.  The \nlegislature considered what the terms of the balance should be when it first created the position: \n\u201c[b]ecause the Special Counsel may be called upon to investigate prohibited personnel practices \nin the executive branch, and to bring disciplinary actions against executive branch officials,\u201d \nCongress \u201cbelieved it [was] essential that [he] be independent of presidential direction and \ncontrol.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 29.  But Congress did not deprive the President of all control over \nthe Special Counsel; it shortened the originally proposed seven-year term limit to five years, and \n \n21   This is true notwithstanding the Supreme Court\u2019s observation in Collins that \u201cdescribing \nan agency as independent would be an odd way to signify that its head is removable only for cause \nbecause even an agency head who is shielded that way would hardly be fully \u2018independent\u2019 of \nPresidential control.\u201d  594 U.S. at 249.  The invocation of the term in this case is not mean to \nsignify that the agency head is removable only for cause, but why. \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 52 of 67\nit allowed the President to remove him for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.  \nSee Civil Services Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat 1111. \nLater, when Congress sought to expand the Special Counsel\u2019s responsibilities in the \nWhistleblower Protection Act, it worked with the President to define the boundaries of his new \nauthority.  Defendants attempt to cherry-pick history, to the extent they are familiar with it, by \nhighlighting certain constitutional objections to the Act voiced by the Office of Legal Counsel and \nPresident Reagan.  Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 3.  But not only do they neglect to mention that those objections \nwere to previous versions of the Act, they omit the fact that the executive branch then worked \nclosely with Congress to overcome the objections after considerable negotiation.  The legislative \nhistory, as a whole, tells a different story than the impression created by defendants\u2019 isolated \ncitations. \nPresident Reagan and his Attorney General took particular issue with the fact that the first \nWhistleblower Protection Act passed by Congress authorized the Special Counsel to obtain \njudicial review of Merits Systems Protection Board decisions because that would pit two executive \nagencies against each other in federal court.  See President Reagan Mem.  But once the President \nvetoed the original bill, Congress worked with the Attorney General to \u201cclip the Special Counsel\u2019s \nwings,\u201d 135 Cong. Rec. 5037 (1989) (statement of Rep. Pat Schroeder), by eliminating that \nauthority altogether.  135 Cong. Rec. 4509 (1989) (statement of Sen. Carl Levin).  After a process \nof negotiation, the same Attorney General, then serving under President George H. W. Bush, \napproved of the \u201cmutually acceptable resolution of [the] serious constitutional concerns,\u201d 135 \nCong.  Rec.  5033\u201334  (1989),  and  President  Bush  then  signed  the  reformed  Whistleblower \nProtection Act into law.  See President Bush Statement.                 \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 53 of 67\nThat history, and the specific role the Office of Special Counsel was designed to play, \nunderlie and justify the presence of the removal restrictions in the statute.  As the Supreme Court \nhas observed: \nWhenever  called  upon  to  judge  the  constitutionality  of  an  Act  of \nCongress . . . the Court accords \u201cgreat weight to the decisions of Congress.\u201d  \nThe Congress is a coequal branch of government whose Members take the \nsame oath we do to uphold the Constitution of the United States. \n \nRostker v. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57, 64 (1981), quoting Columbia Broad. Sys., Inc. v. Democratic \nNat\u2019l Comm., 412 U.S. 94, 102 (1973). \n  The Special Counsel\u2019s statutory duties and powers are set out fully above, and it bears \nrepeating that the terms of his  charter \u2013 the fact that he is authorized to investigate only certain \nforms of government wrongdoing, the lack of true prosecutorial authority, the remedies limited to \nmaking recommendations and complaints to other independent agencies with no right challenge \ntheir decisions, the absence of regulatory authority \u2013 were crafted by the executive and the \nlegislature working together.  Those limitations are why the OSC cannot be accurately described \nas a \u201csingle-Director structure\u201d that \u201cvest[s] significant governmental power in the hands of a \nsingle individual accountable to no one.\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 224.  It is also why the Special \nCounsel does not present the same constitutional threat as an official \u201c[w]ith no colleagues to \npersuade,\u201d who \u201cmay dictate and enforce policy . . . affecting millions of Americans.\u201d  Id. at 225.   \nCollins focuses attention on the \u201cvital purposes\u201d that are \u201cimplicated\u201d whenever the \nPresident\u2019s removal power is at issue.  Collins, 594 U.S. at 252.  As the Supreme Court has \ndescribed it, this specific aspect of a President\u2019s Article II power is coercive and controlling.  See \nHumphrey\u2019s Executor, 295 U.S. at 630 (describing the removal power as a \u201ccoercive influence\u201d).  \n\u201c[I]t is only the authority that can remove [executive] officials that they must fear and, in the \nperformance of [their] functions, obey\u201d the President.  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 213\u201314 (citation and \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 54 of 67\nquotations omitted).  The general power of removal permits a President to fire officers \u201cwho \ndisobey his commands,\u201d \u201chave different views of policy,\u201d or \u201cwho come from a competing \npolitical party who is dead set against [the President\u2019s agenda].\u201d  Collins, 594 U.S. at 256 (citations \nand quotations omitted) \nSuch coercive influence would run directly contrary to the Special Counsel\u2019s unique status \nand mission.  The Special Counsel\u2019s independence ensures that he can fulfill his statutory duty to \nprotect whistleblowers within the federal government, who must feel free to report fraud, waste, \nand abuse or unlawful political activity without fear of retaliation.  It is his independence that \nqualifies him to watch over the time-tested structure that is supposed to bar executive officials \nfrom taking federal jobs from qualified individuals and handing them out to political allies \u2013 a \nsystem that Congress found intolerable over a century ago.  The position would be entirely \nineffective if the Special Counsel were to be compelled to operate with the sword of at-will \nremoval hanging over his head, or if a President, chagrined by whistleblower or merits system \nprotections could undermine the OSC\u2019s independence by threatening to use it.   \nThe Supreme Court imagined a scenario in which \u201can unlucky President\u201d might get \nelected on a specific platform and \u201center office only to find herself saddled with a holdover\u201d \nagency head \u201cwho is dead set against that agenda.\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 225 (emphasis in \noriginal).  But that possibility does not give rise to concerns for the President in the rare situation \npresented here.  The Office of Special Counsel does not have duties that can be characterized as \nimplementing an administration\u2019s agenda, and he cannot frustrate the President\u2019s policies; he \ncannot rewrite or reject regulations, and if he shines a light on wrongdoing, it is up to the \nadministration to choose to do something about it.  The scenario is constitutionally tolerable \nbecause it would not be faithful to the statute as written, or the bipartisan goals it is supposed to \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 55 of 67\nadvance, if the Special Counsel himself is left to fear the very sort of reprisal his position is \ndesigned to prevent. \nII.  The Court will grant the plaintiff\u2019s request to impose equitable remedies in \nfurtherance of its judgment. \nPlaintiff asks the Court to declare that the February 7, 2025 termination was an unlawful, \nultra vires act, and therefore it is null and void and that he is the Special Counsel of the Office of \nSpecial Counsel for the remainder of his five year term unless and until he is removed in \naccordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a71211(b).  Pl.\u2019s Proposed Order [Dkt. # 23-2] at 2.  He also seeks an \norder directed to the subordinate executive branch officials named as defendants in this case that \nplaintiff must be recognized as the Special Counsel, that he must not be obstructed or denied the \nauthorities, benefits, and resources of his office, and that they may not recognize an Acting Special \nCounsel instead.  Id.  These requests fall well within the Court\u2019s jurisdiction, and they will be \ngranted in the order accompanying this opinion. \nA.  The Court has the authority to issue a declaratory judgment and enjoin \nexecutive officials other than the President. \n1.  Declaratory judgment \n28 U.S.C. \u00a72201(a) provides: \n[I]n a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction, . . . any court of the \nUnited States, upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, may declare the \nrights  and  other  legal  relations  of  any  interest  ed  party  seeking  such \ndeclaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought. Any such \ndeclaration shall have the force and effect of a final judgment or decree and \nshall be reviewable as such. \n \nThe defendants challenge the Court\u2019s power to issue a declaratory judgment directed \ntowards the President, on the grounds that it is at bottom an injunction, and therefore subject to the \ntraditional limits on the Court\u2019s equitable authority to enjoin the President.  Defs.\u2019 Reply at 9\u201310.  \nThis seems to ignore the salutary and clarifying effects of the merger of law and equity with the \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 56 of 67\nadoption of the Federal Rules of Civil procedure in 1938, and the fact that Congress established \nthe declaration as a legal remedy in the Declaratory Judgment Act.   \n2.  Injunctive relief \nSince the entry of the TRO, defendants have marshalled considerable authority to support \ntheir position that the Court is not authorized to enjoin the President directly and order him to \nreinstate the plaintiff.  Plaintiff does not dispute this proposition.22  Instead, he has made it very \nclear in his submissions to date, see e.g., Reply in Supp. of Mot. for TRO at 7; Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 19; \nPl.\u2019s Reply at 3, and at the hearing, that he is not seeking an order directing the President to do or \nto stop doing anything.  He asks the Court, once it has entered its declaratory judgment, to direct \nthe other defendants, executive branch officials, to refrain from interfering with his status and \nactivities as the Special Counsel.  This is an order the Court has power to issue.   \nIn Youngstown Sheet & Tube Company v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), the Supreme Court \nremedied the President\u2019s wrongful seizure of the nation\u2019s steel mills through an injunction to his \nsubordinates, and the case continues to be cited for the proposition that \u201ccourts have power to \ncompel subordinate executive officials to disobey illegal Presidential commands.\u201d  Soucie v. \nDavid, 448 F.2d 1067, 1072, n.12 (D.C. Cir. 1971). \nThe approach proposed by the plaintiff was discussed by the D.C. Circuit in Swan v. \nClinton, 100 F.3d 973, 980 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  In Swan, a member of the Board of the National \nCredit Union Administration had been removed by President Clinton, and he sought to have his \nremoval and replacement declared to be unlawful and to be reinstated.  Id. at 974.  Unlike in this \n \n22   See Severino v. Biden, 71 F.4th 1038 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (\u201c[E]njoining the President to make \na formal appointment\u201d is \u201ca constitutionally exceptional step,\u201d and \u201c[a] court generally may not \nenjoin the President in the performance of his official duties.\u201d  Id. at 1042 (internal quotation marks \nomitted), citing Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 802 (1992). \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 57 of 67\ncase, the removal did not contravene the applicable statute since Swan\u2019s term had expired, and he \nwas a holdover Board member when he was replaced.  See id. at 975.  In addressing its own subject \nmatter jurisdiction to hear the case and decide that point, the Court considered the question of the \nredressability of plaintiff\u2019s injury, and the availability of an injunction as relief came up in that \ncontext.  \n[I]njunctive  relief  against  the  President  personally  is  an  extraordinary \nmeasure not lightly to be undertaken. The reasons why courts should be \nhesitant  to  grant  such  relief  are  painfully  obvious;  the  President,  like \nCongress, is a coequal branch of government, and for the President to be \nordered to perform particular executive acts at the behest of the Judiciary at \nbest creates an unseemly appearance of constitutional tension and at worst \nrisks a violation of the constitutional separation of powers. \n \nOn the other side of the scale, of course, is the bedrock principle that our \nsystem of government is founded on the rule of law, and it is sometimes a \nnecessary function of the judiciary to determine if the executive branch is \nabiding by the terms of legislative enactments. In most cases, any conflict \nbetween the desire to avoid confronting the elected head of a coequal branch \nof government and to ensure the rule of law can be successfully bypassed, \nbecause the injury at issue can be rectified by injunctive relief against \nsubordinate officials.  \n \nId. at 978 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).  The Court decided that in Swan\u2019s \nsituation, the remedy could come in the form of an injunction directed towards the executive \ndirector of the Board.  Id. at 980.  In his concurring opinion, Judge Lawrence Silberman chided \nthe majority for its lengthy consideration of its authority to direct the President to rehire someone \nin a case in which the firing at issue was not unlawful in the first place.  See id. at 989\u201391 \n(Silberman, J., concurring).  But he agreed that if the Court had found that the plaintiff should \nremain in the position, the better course would be to simply order the other executive branch \nofficials to recognize his status.  Id. at 988\u201389.  The Circuit later repeated that a court can \u201cenjoin \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 58 of 67\n\u2018subordinate executive officials\u2019 to reinstate a wrongly terminated official \u2018de facto\u2019\u201d to redress \nthe official\u2019s injury.  Severino, 71 F.4th at 1042\u201343, quoting Swan, 100 F. 3d. at 980.23  \nFinally,  to  support  their  argument  that  plaintiff  is  not  entitled  to  injunctive  relief, \ndefendants point to a line of cases in which federal officials removed from their positions pursued \nsuits for back pay.  See Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 16.  While it is true that the plaintiffs in Shurtleff v. United \nStates, 189 U.S. 311 (1903), Myers, 272 U.S. 52, Humphrey\u2019s Executor, 295 U.S. 602, and Wiener \nv. United States, 357 U.S. 349 (1958), were seeking to recover monetary compensation, none of \nthose cases stands for or even purported to address the proposition that no the other remedy was \navailable.24  The issue in Shurtleff was whether the President could remove an officer \u201cfor any \nother causes other than those mentioned\u201d in a for-cause removal restriction.  189 U.S. at 314.  \nMyers addressed whether the President could remove a postmaster without the consent of the \n \n23   Plaintiff also suggests that a writ of mandamus might be available to order the other \ngovernment officials to perform a purely ministerial act, citing Severino v. Biden, 71 F.4th 1038.  \nSee Tr. at 25.  During the redressability analysis in that case, the Court again reviewed what might \nbe possible, and it observed that Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. at 788, \u201cleft open a narrow \npotential exception for injunctions that require the President to perform a \u2018purely \u201cministerial\u201d \nduty\u2019 over which he has no discretion.\u201d  As in Swan, the Court chose not to tackle the question of \nwhether, under its precedent, an injunction to reinstate an official could qualify as \u201cministerial.\u201d  \nId.  While there is no need to address the question with respect to the President since plaintiff is \nnot asking that he be joined, the Court has similar qualms about whether acquiescing in Dellinger\u2019s \nstatus and refraining from interfering with the performance of his duties for five years could be \nclassified as \u201cministerial,\u201d so it will leave the question of mandamus for another day.  \n \n24   Defendants also point to Parsons v. United States, 167 U.S. 324 (1897), describing it as a \nsuit for \u201csalary and fees,\u201d Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 16, but that description does not tell the whole story.  In \nthat case, when President Grover Cleveland attempted to remove the United States Attorney for \nthe Northern and Middle District of Alabama without cause, the U.S. Attorney \u201crespectfully \ndecline[d] to surrender the office.\u201d  Id. at 325.  The individual President Cleveland had named as \nsuccessor then sued the U.S. Attorney to require him to \u201cturn over . . . all the books and papers and \nother property appertaining to the office.\u201d  Id. at 326.  After the successor won in the lower court, \nthe deposed U.S. Attorney filed a petition for a writ mandamus in the Supreme Court to vacate the \norder, and that petition also sought the recovery of \u201csalary and fees.\u201d  Id.      \n \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 59 of 67\nSenate.  272 U.S. at 107\u201308, 109.  Reinstatement was not an issue since Myers was deceased.  See \nid. at 106.  Humphrey\u2019s Executor determined whether for-cause removal protection for the \nCommissioners of the Federal Trade Commission violated the President\u2019s removal power, and as \nin Myers, the case was being pursued after his death.  295 U.S. at 618\u201319.  And Weiner \n\u201cpresent[ed] a variant of the constitutional issue\u201d in Humphrey\u2019s, addressing whether the President \ncould remove a member of the quasi-judicial War Claims Commission.  Weiner, 357 U.S. at 350\u2013\n51.  Reinstatement was not an issue because Congress abolished the Commission before the case \nwas resolved.  See id. at 350. \nSo the Court finds it proper to enjoin defendants Bessent, Gor, Gorman, Kamman, and \nVought, ordering them to recognize plaintiff Dellinger\u2019s authority as Special Counsel unless and \nuntil he is removed in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b). 25  \n \n25   Defendants cite White v. Berry, 171 U.S. 366 (1898), Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 1, in which the U.S. \nCollector of Internal Revenue removed an official who had been appointed to a position by the \nSecretary of the Treasury, because he was a Democrat and the Collector wanted to replace him \nwith a republican.   Id. at 366\u201367.  The lower court held that the removal violated the Pendleton \nCivil Service Act and that it had the authority to \u201cto restrain the appointing power from removing\u201d \nthe plaintiff because it was unlawful.  Id. at 376.  The Supreme Court found it to be \u201cwell settled \nthat a court of equity has no jurisdiction over the appointment and removal of public officers,\u201d id. \nat 377, and it vacated the order.  But it confirmed that \u201c[t]he jurisdiction to determine the title to a \npublic office belongs exclusively to the courts of law.\u201d  Id.  This reaffirms the Court\u2019s power to \nissue declaratory relief, but it does not bear on the requested injunction since plaintiff is not \nrequesting an order that anyone be removed or reinstated.  White v. Berry is relevant in that the \nSupreme Court plainly recognized that the power to remove or replace officials had regularly been \nexercised by courts throughout the country\u2019s history, albeit in a manner that honored the then-\nexisting separation between courts of law and courts of equity:  \u201ceither by certiorari, error, or \nappeal, or by mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto, or information in the nature of a writ of quo \nwarranto, according to the circumstances of the case, and the mode of procedure established by \ncommon law or by statute.\u201d  Id.  In short, there are many parallels to remedies that have been \nawarded in the past.  Plaintiff has cited a line of authorities in which the quo warranto procedure \nwas utilized to resolve disputes over title to an office, see Reply in Supp. of Mot. for TRO at 7, \nand Pl.\u2019s Reply at 4, n.3, and the Court agrees that his prayer for relief is sufficiently broad to \nencompass a request for this or another form of legal relief if recharacterizing it is necessary, \nespecially since the Court is not ordering that anyone be appointed or removed. \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 60 of 67\nB.  The permanent injunction factors support the issuance of an injunction. \nA plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction must demonstrate that:  (1) he has suffered an \nirreparable injury; (2) remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to \ncompensate for that injury; (3) considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and \ndefendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) the public interest would not be disserved by \na permanent injunction.  Monsanto Co., 561 U.S. at 156\u201357, quoting eBay Inc., 547 U.S. at 391.  \n\u201cThe decision to grant or deny permanent injunctive relief is an act of equitable discretion by the \ndistrict court.  eBay, 547 U.S. at 391.  \u201cThe purpose of an injunction is to prevent future violations\u201d \nwhere there is \u201ccognizable danger of recurrent violation.\u201d Anatol Zukerman & Charles Krause \nReporting, LLC v. U.S. Postal Serv., 64 F.4th 1354, 1363\u201364 (D.C. Cir. 2023), quoting, United \nStates v. W.T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 633 (1953).  But \u201c[i]f a less drastic remedy\u201d is \u201csufficient \nto redress\u201d the injury, the \u201cextraordinary relief of an injunction\u201d is not warranted.  Monsanto Co., \n561 U.S. at 165\u201366.   \n1.  Irreparable Harm and Inadequate Remedy at Law \nPlaintiff reminds the Court that his motion for a temporary relief argued that removal would \ncause him irreparable harm by depriving him of his \u201cstatutory right to function in his office,\u201d which \ncould not be remedied by a post-judgment award of damages.  Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 27\u201328.  It is now the \nstage where judgment is being awarded, so the option of deferring injunctive relief because the \nproblem can be remedied later is no longer available, and the Court did not find that adequate at \nthe outset of the lawsuit anyway.  See TRO Order at 20\u201321.  Because at this point in the \nproceedings, there is substantial overlap between the claimed irreparable injury and the lack of an \nadequate remedy at law, the Court will consider these two factors together, as other courts in this \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 61 of 67\ndistrict have done.  See, e.g., Ridgley v. Lew, 55 F. Supp. 3d 89, 98 (D.D.C. 2014); Kymber \nConsulting Grp., LLC. v. Cato, No. 22-1042 (JMC), 2022 WL 7488185, at *3 (D.D.C. 2022).          \n  As the Court of Appeals has explained, \u201c[m]ere injuries, however substantial, in terms of \nmoney, time and energy necessarily expended in the absence of a stay are not enough\u201d to prove \nirreparable harm.  Wisc. Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (per curiam), \nquoting Va. Petroleum Jobbers Ass\u2019n v. FPC, 259 F.2d 921, 925 (D.C. Cir. 1958).26   \n  Plaintiff has made a sufficient showing of irreparable harm that cannot be remediated \nthrough a damages award.  As the Court has explained, unless he is removed for inefficiency, \nneglect of duty, or malfeasance, plaintiff has a statutory duty to fulfill:  to \u201cprotect employees, \nformer employees, and applicants for employment from prohibited personnel practices.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1212(a)(1).  The purported removal without cause renders him unable to fulfill that duty, a loss \nthat can never be restored, and therefore it gives rise to irreparable harm.  And as plaintiff \npredicted, the harm he feared was impending was not mere speculation; defendants compounded \nthe problem when they notified the Court, the President has already \u201cdesignated the Secretary of \nVeteran Affairs, Doug Collins, to serve as Acting Special Counsel,\u201d during the pendency of the \nCourt\u2019s proceedings.  Notice of Designation at 1.   \n  Defendants\u2019 contentions with respect to this factor are unpersuasive.  They tend to repeat \nthe  arguments  they  made  against  the  TRO,  characterizing  plaintiff\u2019s  injury  as  a  loss  of \n\u201cemployment and salary\u201d and then asserting that it is not irreparable because \u201c[a] court can \ngenerally repair an injury to an individual from loss of employment by awarding post judgment \n \n26   Defendants cite Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290 (D.C. Cir. \n2006) for their argument that plaintiff does not meet the \u201chigh standard for irreparable injury.\u201d  \nDefs.\u2019 Mot. at 20 (quotations omitted).  But that case addresses the test for interim relief, not \nwhether an injunction would be appropriate after litigation concludes.  Id. at 293.   \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 62 of 67\nrelief such as backpay.\u201d  Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 20; Defs.\u2019 Reply at 12.  Plaintiff has never even brought \nup the subject of his salary.   \nDefendants rely on Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 83 (1974), as they did at the TRO \nstage.  Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 20.  The Court addressed Sampson in its order granting the TRO.  See TRO \nOrder at 17\u201324.  Sampson involved a probationary employee who sought to enjoin the General \nServices Administration from discharging her, arguing that the discharge would cause irreparable \nharm by depriving her of income and causing \u201cher to suffer the embarrassment of being wrongfully \ndischarged.\u201d 415 U.S. at 62\u201363, 66. The allegations themselves differentiate that case from this \none. Sampson also acknowledged that its analysis was \u201cdealing\u201d with a particular class of \nemployee \u2013 a \u201cprobationary\u201d one.  Id. at 80\u201381.  And while it rejected injunctive relief in her \nsituation, it made it clear it was not shutting the door entirely:     \n[C]ases may arise in which the circumstances surrounding an employee\u2019s \ndischarge, together with the resultant effect on the employee, may so far \ndepart from the normal situation that irreparable injury might be found. \nSuch extraordinary cases are hard to define in advance of their occurrence \n. . . .  [W]e do not wish to be understood as foreclosing relief in the \ngenuinely extraordinary situation.  Use of the court\u2019s injunctive power, \nhowever, when discharge of probationary employees is an issue, should be \nreserved for that situation rather than employed in the routine case. \n  \nId. at 92 n.68. \n  This is not a routine case dealing with a terminated probationary employee.  Plaintiff \nDellinger was appointed to serve a statutory term of five years, which he was doing until his \nsudden, unexplained removal.  Ex. A.  And he is not claiming the same irreparable injury as the \nSampson plaintiff, nor could his claimed injury \u2013 deprivation of his statutory right to function \u2013 be \ncompared to the loss of income or embarrassment involved in the typical employment action, for \nwhich there are remedies that do not involve equitable relief.  As the Court stated in the temporary \nrestraining order: \n62 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 63 of 67\nThis  case  falls  outside  of  the  typical  paradigm  since  the  OSC  is  an \nindependent agency and the White House is not plaintiff\u2019s employer. In \nshort, plaintiff\u2019s injury stems directly from \u201cextraordinary\u201d circumstances \nas Sampson requires; namely, that for the first time, a President has removed \nthe Special Counsel from his statutorily prescribed term without any cause \nor explanation. \n \nTRO Order at 19.   \n  Defendants now point to Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811 (1997), as well, and they argue that \n\u201closs of political power\u201d is not a cognizable harm.  Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 20.  But Raines is not on point.  \nIn Raines, six members of Congress sued the Secretary of the Treasury and the Office of \nManagement and Budget to challenge the constitutionality of the Line-Item Veto Act, which \nauthorized the President to \u201c\u2018cancel\u2019 certain spending and tax benefits measures after he . . . signed \nthem into law.\u201d  Id. at 814.  The plaintiffs had voted against the Act, id., and, for standing purposes, \nalleged that the law injured them by:  (1) altering the legal and practical effect of all votes they \nmay cast on bills with vetoable items;  (2) divesting them of their constitutional role in the repeal \nof legislation; and (3) altering the constitutional balance of powers between the legislative and \nexecutive branches.  Id. at 816.  The Court held that none of these injuries were sufficient for \nstanding because the fact that they had \u201csimply lost\u201d the vote on the Line-Item Veto Act did not \nimplicate the invasion of legally protected interest to give rise to the necessary injury-in fact.  Id. \nat 827\u201329.   \nPlaintiff Dellinger is not a member of Congress, this case does not involve a single vote, \nno one has challenged plaintiff\u2019s standing, and he does not assert a reduction of his \u201cpolitical \npower.\u201d  Plaintiff was injured by the deprivation of his statutory right to function at all when the \nPresident attempted to remove him without cause.   \nDefendants also assert that the dissent in Barnes v. Kline, 759 F.2d 21 (D.C. Cir. 1984), \nvacated on other grounds, 479 U.S. 361 (1987), supports the argument that public officials do not \n63 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 64 of 67\nhave a \u201cseparate private right\u201d to their office.  Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 20, citing Barnes, 759 F.2d at 50 \n(Bork, J., dissenting).  As the reliance on a dissent tends to signal, Barnes does not support their \nposition.  In that case, thirty-three members of Congress sued two executive officials to challenge \nthe constitutionality of the President\u2019s \u201cpocket veto\u201d power, which President Reagan had exercised \nto veto the International Security and Development Co-operation Act.  Id. at 23\u201324.  The D.C. \nCircuit held that the plaintiffs \u201cclearly ha[d] standing to litigate\u201d the case, over the dissent by Judge \nBork cited by defendants.  Id. at 29.  So, that case does not provide much support either, and the \nprinciple it is cited to advance is undermined by defendants\u2019 simultaneous insistence that plaintiff \nis not entitled to an injunction because he could sue for backpay damages.  See Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 16\u2013\n17 (citing five previous Supreme Court cases in which removed officers were allowed to bring suit \nover their removal). \nThe Court finds that plaintiff has demonstrated both that he would suffer irreparable harm \nin the absence of injunctive relief and that he lacks an adequate remedy at law.   \n2.  Balance of the Equities and Public Interest \nThe next set of factors are whether the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and \ndefendant warrants an equitable remedy, and whether the injunction serves the public interest.  \nMonsanto Co., 561 U.S. at 157.  As they did at the TRO stage, both parties advance the arguments \nconcerning these factors together.  See Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 21\u201323; Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 28\u201329.  Because the \nCourt finds that they are intertwined, and the Supreme Court has instructed that \u201cassessing the \nharm to the opposing party and weighing the public interest . . . merge when the [g]overnment is \nthe opposing party,\u201d Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009), the Court will consider them \ntogether.     \n64 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 65 of 67\nThe Department of Justice wrings its hands over the harm that could flow from what it calls \na \u201cspecial exception for the Special Counsel\u201d to the President\u2019s Article II power, Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 8, \nasserting that this inflicts harm on the President by depriving him of \u201ccontrol over an entire \nexecutive department.\u201d  Defs\u2019 Reply at 12.  But plaintiff is not seeking to be excepted from binding \ncase authorities; his position is that the OSC was not covered by them in the first place.  See Tr. at \n4\u20135.  Moreover, the instant decision is extremely narrow and sui generis, and it does not result in \nthe diminution of the President\u2019s powers; this is the only single-headed agency left for the courts \nto consider, and it is unlike any of them.  Thus, recognizing the unique nature of the OSC will be \nno threat to the Framers\u2019 decision, made manifest in Article II, to make \u201ca single President \nresponsible for the actions of the Executive Branch.\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 224, citing Free \nEnter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 477.  \n On the other side of the equation, one cannot deny the proposition that the Special \nCounsel\u2019s singular role, and preserving his independence in carrying it out, advance the public \ninterest.  That was the genesis of the Whistleblower Protection Act and the particular provisions \nat issue.  The protection the OSC offers to enable whistleblowers to come forward with information \nabout wrongdoing without fear of reprisal is critical to ensuring that those instances of wrongdoing \nare corrected, to the benefit of both the government and the public at large.  Both houses of \nCongress  have consistently  emphasized the need for robust support for whistleblowers; for \nexample, on July 30, 2023, the Senate passed a resolution introduced by Senator Chuck Grassley \n(R-Iowa) designating the date as \u201cNational Whistleblower Day.\u201d  S. Res. 793, 118th Cong. (July \n31, 2023).  The resolution was a reminder that: \n[W]histleblowers  risk  their  careers,  jobs,  and  reputations  by  reporting \nwaste, fraud, and abuse to the proper authorities . . . .  [I]n providing the \nproper  authorities  with  lawful  disclosures,  whistleblowers  save  the \ntaxpayers of the United States billions of dollars each year and serve the \n65 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 66 of 67\npublic interest by ensuring that the United States remains an ethical and safe \nplace[.] \n \nId. at 2.  The benefits of a duly appointed Special Counsel, operating free of partisan pressure far \noutweigh any harms identified by the defendants. \nThe Court is therefore skeptical of defendants\u2019 assertion that \u201cthe public would be better \nserved by the appointment of a principal officer who holds the President\u2019s confidence.\u201d  Defs.\u2019 \nMot. at 22.  There has been no indication here that plaintiff has been acting in a partisan or biased \nmanner; to the contrary, for example, his recent finding vindicating complaints by IRS agents that \nwere retaliated against for raising concerns about the treatment of Hunter Biden during President \nBiden\u2019s administration spurred Senators Charles Grassley and Ron Johnson to implore President \nTrump  to  protect  those  individuals.    Letter from  Senator  Charles  E.  Grassley,  Chairman \nCommittee  on  the  Judiciary,  and  Ron  Johnson,  Chairman,  Permanent  Subcommittee  on \nInvestigations to President Donald J. Trump (Feb. 6, 2025), http://www.grassley.senate.gov/ \nimo/media/doc/grassley_johnson_to_trump_-_irs_whistleblower_retaliation.pdf.  That happened \njust one day before plaintiff\u2019s purported termination.  And the suggestion that the public is \nnecessarily better served by the President\u2019s choice runs contrary to the Court\u2019s earlier findings \nabout the critical importance of independence in this particular position.  Moreover, it is enough \nto satisfy the final two factors when considering a permanent injunction to find that an injunction \nto preserve the status quo of plaintiff\u2019s position does not harm the public, and therefore, the \npotential that a President may have qualms that fall far short of the statutory reasons for dismissal \ndoes not counsel against relief.    \n \n \n \n66 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 67 of 67\nCONCLUSION \nFor all of the reasons set forth above, the Court will enter judgment in favor of plaintiff on \nCount One, and it will award the declaratory and injunctive relief set forth in the accompanying \norder. \n \nAMY BERMAN JACKSON \nUnited States District Judge \n \nDATE:  March 1, 2025  \n67\n\nClearinghouse file: https://clearinghouse-umich-production.s3.amazonaws.com/media/doc/156439.pdf\nExternal link: https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69624836/32/dellinger-v-bessent/\nClearinghouse summary: clearinghouse.net/doc/156439"

It granted plaintiff\u2019s motion for summary judgment \non Count One of his complaint, ordered declaratory judgment and injunction relief, and denied \ndefendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment.  See Order.  The same night, defendants noticed an \nappeal to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.  See Notice of Appeal \n[Dkt. # 34].  To ensure compliance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 8(a), which requires \nthem to \u201cordinarily move first in the district court for\u201d a stay pending appeal, defendants also filed \na motion to stay the Court\u2019s order pending appeal.  See Motion to Stay the Ct.\u2019s Order Pending \nAppeal [Dkt. # 36].        \n   \n  The court considers four factors in connection with a motion to stay:  (1) whether the stay \napplicant has made a strong showing that they are likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the \napplicant  will  be  irreparably  injured  absent  a  stay;  (3)  whether  issuance  of  the  stay  will \nsubstantially injure the other parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest \nlies.

The Supreme Court has explained that the first \ntwo factors \u201care the most critical.\u201d  Id.   \n \nWith respect to the first factor, the Court of Appeals has stated that \u201c[i]t is not enough that \nthe chance of success on the merits [is] better than negligible.\u201d  Id. (internal quotation marks and \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 39     Filed 03/03/25     Page 2 of 3\ncitation omitted).  Instead, it must be \u201csubstantial[.]\u201d  Washington Metro. Area Transit Comm\u2019n v. \nHoliday Tours, Inc., 559 F.2d 841, 843 (D.C. Cir. 1977).  The Court has also observed that a \nmovant\u2019s failure to satisfy this stringent standard for demonstrating a likelihood of success on the \nmerits is \u201can arguably fatal flaw for a stay application.\u201d  Citizens for Responsibility & Ethics in \nWashington v. Fed. Election Comm\u2019n (\u201cCREW\u201d), 904 F.3d 1014, 1019 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (per \ncuriam); see Ark. Dairy Co-op Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Agric., 573 F.3d 815, 832 (D.C. Cir. \n2009) (affirming the denial of injunctive relief where the plaintiff failed to show likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits). \n \nThe second factor, similarly, requires more than the mere \u201cpossibility of irreparable \ninjury.\u201d  Nken, 556 U.S. at 434 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  \u201cIrreparable harm \nmust be \u2018both certain and great[,]\u2019 and \u2018actual and not theoretical.\u2019\u201d  CREW, 904 F.3d at 1019, \nquoting Wis. Gas Co. v. F.E.R.C., 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985).  Where there is a low \nlikelihood of success on merits, a movant must show a proportionally greater irreparable injury, \nsee Cuomo v. U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Comm\u2019n, 772 F.2d 972, 974 (D.C. Cir. 1985), to warrant \nthe \u201cextraordinary remedy\u201d of a stay.  Id. at 978.  The last two factors, \u201cthe harm to the opposing \nparty and weighing the public interest . . . merge when the Government is the opposing party.\u201d  \nNken, 556 U.S. at 435. \n \nHere, for all of the reasons stated in the order granting plaintiff\u2019s motion for temporary \nrestraining  order  [Dkt.  #  14],  the  order  denying  defendants\u2019  motion  to  stay  the  temporary \nrestraining order [Dkt. # 19], and the memorandum opinion granting plaintiff\u2019s motion for \nsummary judgment [Dkt. # 32], the Court cannot find that defendants have a substantial likelihood \nof success on the merits of their appeal given the undisputed violation of a clear statutory provision, \nand the close nature of the constitutional question which is not controlled by the cited authorities.  \nAlso, importantly, defendants have not met the high burden of demonstrating irreparable harm at \nthis stage of the proceedings.  Any harm to the President\u2019s Article II powers to appoint his own \nSpecial Counsel, the head of a unique agency with limited regulatory power and enforcement \nauthority, can and will be remedied completely if the Court\u2019s decision is overturned.  Finally, as \nnoted in previous rulings, the public interest in the Special Counsel\u2019s independence outweighs the \ndefendants\u2019 interests at this time.   \n \nFor these reasons, defendants\u2019 motion to stay pending appeal [Dkt. # 36] is DENIED. \n \nSO ORDERED. \n \n \n \nAMY BERMAN JACKSON \nUnited States District Judge \n \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 39     Filed 03/03/25     Page 3 of 3\nDATE:  March 3, 2025  \n3\n\nClearinghouse file: https://clearinghouse-umich-production.s3.amazonaws.com/media/doc/156500.pdf\nExternal link: https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69624836/39/dellinger-v-bessent/\nClearinghouse summary: clearinghouse.net/doc/156500"

In addition, the Acting Solicitor General respectfully requests an im-\nmediate administrative stay of the district court\u2019s order pending the Court\u2019s consid-\neration of this application. \nThis case involves an unprecedented assault on the separation of powers that \nwarrants immediate relief.  As this Court observed just last Term, \u201cCongress cannot \nact on, and courts cannot examine, the President\u2019s actions on subjects within his \u2018con-\nclusive and preclusive\u2019 constitutional authority\u201d\u2014including \u201cthe President\u2019s \u2018unre-\nstricted power of removal\u2019 with respect to \u2018executive officers of the United States \nwhom [the President] has appointed.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593, 609 \n(2024) (citation omitted).  As to such principal officers\u2014\u201cthe most important of his \n(1) \n\n2 \nsubordinates\u201d\u2014\u201c[t]he President\u2019s \u2018management of the Executive Branch\u2019 requires \nhim to have \u2018unrestricted power to remove\u2019 them \u2018in their most important duties.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nId. at 621 (citation omitted).  Enjoining the President and preventing him from exer-\ncising these powers thus inflicts the gravest of injuries on the Executive Branch and \nthe separation of powers. \nIn the last five years, this Court has twice held that restrictions on the Presi-\ndent\u2019s authority to remove principal officers who serve as the sole heads of executive \nagencies violate Article II\u2014in those cases, the single heads of the Consumer Finan-\ncial Protection Bureau and the Federal Housing Finance Agency.  See Seila Law LLC \nv. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020); Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (2021).  Whatever the \nagency, for the President to discharge his constitutional duty to supervise those who \nexercise executive power on his behalf, the President can \u201cremove the head of an \nagency with a single top officer\u201d at will.  Collins, 594 U.S. at 256.  On that basis, \nPresident Biden in 2021 fired the single head of the Social Security Administration \nwithout cause. \nThus,  when  President  Trump,  on  February  7,  2025,  removed  respondent \nHampton Dellinger as the single head of the Office of Special Counsel, he engaged in \nan uncontroversial exercise of his Article II powers.  Since the Carter Administration, \nthe Executive Branch has repeatedly expressed the view that tenure protections for \nthe head of the Office of Special Counsel in 5 U.S.C. 1211(b) violate the Constitution.  \nThat is because this agency presents a particularly clear-cut case.  \u201cInvestigative and \nprosecutorial decisionmaking is \u2018the special province of the Executive Branch,\u2019 and \nthe Constitution vests the entirety of the executive power in the President.\u201d  Trump, \n603 U.S. at 620 (citation omitted).  The Office of Special Counsel operates as a self-\ndescribed \u201cinvestigative and prosecutorial agency.\u201d  https://osc.gov/Agency.  The Of-\n \n\n3 \nfice enforces federal laws governing federal employment and federal whistleblowers, \nissues subpoenas and rules, and can in some circumstances require other agency \nheads to \u201cconduct an investigation and submit a written report.\u201d  5 U.S.C. 1212(a)(2), \n(b)(2), (e), (h)(1); 5 U.S.C. 1213(a), (c)(2);  5 U.S.C. 1216(a).  The President\u2019s removal \nof respondent accordingly implicated two preclusive presidential powers: the power \nto remove and the power to control investigative and prosecutorial decisionmaking.  \nYet, within hours of respondent filing suit and before the government had the \nopportunity to respond, the district court issued an 8:35 p.m. order on February 10, \n2025, labeled an \u201cadministrative stay.\u201d  That order restored respondent to the office \nfrom which the President had removed him, enjoined any efforts to impede his \u201caccess \nto the resources or materials of that office,\u201d and barred the President from installing \n\u201cany other person as Special Counsel.\u201d  On February 12, the district court then issued \na 27-page opinion granting a \u201ctemporary restraining order\u201d enjoining the President \nand other senior Executive Branch officials and restoring respondent to office.  See \nApp., infra, 4a-30a.  The court set that TRO to last a full 14 days and specified that a \nhearing on an \u201cappealable\u201d order would not be held until February 26.  Id. at 30a.   \nUntil now, as far as we are aware, no court in American history has wielded \nan injunction to force the President to retain an agency head whom the President \nbelieves should not be entrusted with executive power and to prevent the President \nfrom relying on his preferred replacement.  Yet the district court remarkably found \nno irreparable harm to the President if he is judicially barred from exercising exclu-\nsive and preclusive powers of the Presidency for at least 16 days, and perhaps for a \nmonth.  See Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b)(2) (authorizing courts to extend \nTROs so that they last up to 28 days).  And, when the United States sought a stay or, \nalternatively, mandamus, the D.C. Circuit issued a 27-page decision denying relief \n \n\n4 \nlate on Saturday night, over Judge Katsas\u2019s dissent.  App., infra, 33a-59a.     \nThe United States now seeks this Court\u2019s intervention because these judicial \nrulings irreparably harm the Presidency by curtailing the President\u2019s ability to man-\nage the Executive Branch in the earliest days of his Administration.  As Judge Katsas \nobserved, the TRO\u2014which operates as an injunction against the President and re-\nquires him to reinstate an agency head whom he removed\u2014is \u201cvirtually unheard of,\u201d \nid. at 54a, and \u201cusurped a core Article II power of the President,\u201d id. at 53a.  \u201c[C]ourts \nmay not enjoin the President regarding the performance of his official acts, regarding \nremoval or otherwise.\u201d  Id. at 54a.  Even when courts do not enjoin the President \nhimself, this Court has long held that a court \u201cwill not, by injunction, restrain an \nexecutive officer from making a wrongful removal of a subordinate appointee, nor \nrestrain the appointment of another.\u201d  White v. Berry, 171 U.S. 366, 377 (1898).  Thus, \nchallenges to removals have historically been litigated through suits for back pay, not \nreinstatement.  E.g., Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602, 618 (1935); \nMyers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 106 (1926).   \nThis Court should not allow lower courts to seize executive power by dictating \nto the President how long he must continue employing an agency head against his \nwill.  \u201cWhere a lower court allegedly impinges on the President\u2019s core Article II pow-\ners, immediate appellate review should be generally available.\u201d  App., infra, at 52a \n(Katsas, J., dissenting).  Yet the D.C. Circuit majority described \u201c[w]aiting two weeks\u201d \nto exercise the executive power vested by Article II as \u201cnot so prejudicial.\u201d  Id. at 41a.  \nIf that reasoning is allowed to stand, it is hard to conceive of any TRO that would \ntrigger appellate review.  Such a ruling risks further emboldening district courts to \nissue TROs enjoining the President from undertaking myriad other actions implicat-\ning executive powers. \n \n\n5 \nThat is no mere hypothetical.  The district court\u2019s order exemplifies a broader, \nweeks-long trend in which plaintiffs challenging President Trump\u2019s initiatives have \npersuaded district courts to issue TROs that intrude upon a host of the President\u2019s \nArticle II powers.  A district court in New York issued an ex parte TRO requiring that \naccess to certain Treasury Department data be limited to \u201ccivil servants\u201d and be de-\nnied to \u201cpolitical appointees.\u201d  New York v. Trump, No. 25-cv-1144, 2025 WL 435411, \nat *1 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 8, 2025).  A district court in the District of Columbia issued a \nworldwide TRO that prohibited the government from \u201csuspending, pausing, or other-\nwise preventing the obligation or disbursement\u201d of any \u201cfederal foreign assistance \naward that was in existence as of January 19, 2025.\u201d  AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coali-\ntion v. United States Department of State, No. 25-cv-402, 2025 WL 485324, at *7 \n(D.D.C. 2025).  Many other district courts have issued universal TROs that sweep far \nbeyond the parties to those cases and effectively enjoin the President\u2019s Executive Or-\nders even before agencies have decided how to implement them.1   \nThe United States thus respectfully requests that this Court vacate the district \ncourt\u2019s order and end the practice whereby courts seize Article II powers for two \nweeks, yet disclaim the availability of any appellate review in the meantime.  This \nCourt should not allow the judiciary to govern by temporary restraining order and \nsupplant the political accountability the Constitution ordains.    \nSTATEMENT \n1.

The Office began as \u201cthe in-\nvestigative and prosecutorial arm of the Merit Systems Protection Board\u201d (MSPB).  \nU.S. Office of Special Counsel Annual Report for Fiscal Year 2023, at 9 (OSC Annual \nReport).2  Congress made the Office a freestanding agency in 1989.  See Whistle-\nblower Protection Act of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-12, 103 Stat. 16. \nThe Office of Special Counsel remains an \u201cinvestigative and prosecutorial \nagency.\u201d  https://osc.gov/Agency.  The Office executes certain provisions of four federal \nstatutes governing the federal workforce: the Civil Service Reform Act, which regu-\nlates the civil-service system; the Whistleblower Protection Act, which forbids repris-\nals against federal whistleblowers; the Hatch Act of 1939, Pub. L. No. 76-252, 53 Stat. \n1147, which restricts political activity by federal employees; and the Uniformed Ser-\nvices Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), Pub. L. No. 103-\n353, 108 Stat. 3149, which forbids employment discrimination against service mem-\nbers and veterans.  The Office promulgates regulations, receives and investigates al-\nlegations of wrongdoing, and brings disciplinary actions.  5 U.S.C. 1212-1216.  When \na \u201cmeritorious case cannot be resolved through negotiation with the agency involved,\u201d \nthe Office\u2019s Investigation and Prosecution Division \u201cmay bring an enforcement action \nbefore the MSPB.\u201d  OSC Annual Report 11.  Similarly, its Hatch Act Unit \u201cseek[s] \ndisciplinary actions before the MSPB,\u201d id. at 12, and its USERRA Unit \u201cenforces\u201d \nUSERRA, including by \u201clitigating complaints referred from the U.S. Department of \nLabor,\u201d ibid.  The Office can even, in certain circumstances, \u201crequire an agency head \nto conduct an investigation and submit a written report.\u201d 5 U.S.C. 1213(a), (c)(2). \nIn Fiscal Year 2023, the Office of Special Counsel had approximately 129 full-\n \n2  https://osc.gov/Documents/Resources/Congressional_Matters/Annual_ \nReports_to_Congress/FY_2023_Annual_Report_to_Congress.pdf \n \n\n7 \ntime-equivalent employees and $31.9 million in appropriated funding.  OSC Annual \nReport 13.  The office received 4,611 new cases that year.  Ibid.  That is \u201cbelow the \naverage of 5,900 cases received in the five years immediately preceding the [COVID-\n19] pandemic\u201d; the Office \u201cexpects a return to pre-pandemic caseload levels in future \nfiscal years.\u201d  Ibid. \nThe Office of Special Counsel is \u201cheaded by the Special Counsel.\u201d  5 U.S.C. \n1211(a).  The Special Counsel is appointed by the President, with the advice and con-\nsent of the Senate, for a term of five years.  See 5 U.S.C. 1211(b).  The Special Counsel \nhas the statutory authority to appoint subordinate agency personnel, see 5 U.S.C. \n1212(d), and the constitutional authority to supervise those officials\u2019 exercise of exec-\nutive power, see United States v. Arthrex, 594 U.S. 1, 13 (2021).   \nThe Civil Service Reform Act provides that the Special Counsel \u201cmay be re-\nmoved by the President only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d  \n5 U.S.C. 1211(b).  Since 1978, however, the Executive Branch has repeatedly raised \nconstitutional objections to that restriction on the President\u2019s removal power.  See \nSeila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197, 221 (2020).  For instance, in the Carter Ad-\nministration, the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel explained that, \n\u201c[b]ecause the Special Counsel [would] be performing largely executive functions, the \nCongress [could] not restrict the President\u2019s power to remove him.\u201d  2 Op. O.L.C. 120, \n121 (1978).  President Reagan pocket-vetoed a bill \u201con constitutional grounds\u201d be-\ncause the bill would have vested the Office of Special Counsel with additional powers.  \nSeila Law, 591 U.S. at 221.  And the government filed a brief in this Court in 2020 \nexplaining that \u201cthe President must have the power to remove at will the single \nhea[d] of the  * * *  Office of Special Counsel.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Reply & Response Br. at 26, \nCollins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (No. 19-422).  \n \n\n8 \n2.  In March 2024, President Biden, with the advice and consent of the Sen-\nate, appointed respondent Hampton Dellinger to serve as Special Counsel.  See \nCompl. \u00b6 1.  On Friday, February 7, 2025, the Director of the White House Presiden-\ntial Personnel Office informed respondent that President Trump had removed him \nfrom office effective immediately.  Id. \u00b6 2.  \nOn February 10, the following Monday, respondent brought this suit in the \nU.S. District Court for the District of Columbia to challenge his removal.  App., infra, \n9a.  Respondent moved for a temporary restraining order reinstating him as Special \nCounsel.  See D. Ct. Doc. 2.  Before the government could respond to the motion, the \ncourt held a near-immediate hearing.  Hours later, the court entered what it de-\nscribed as a \u201cbrief administrative stay\u201d that would last until midnight on February \n13.  D. Ct. 2/10/25 Minute Order.  That order restored respondent to the post of Spe-\ncial Counsel and enjoined applicants from \u201cdeny[ing] him access to the resources or \nmaterials of that office or recogniz[ing] the authority of any other person as Special \nCounsel.\u201d  Ibid.  The next day, the President designated Secretary of Veterans Affairs \nDoug Collins as Acting Special Counsel, but the court\u2019s order prevented the Executive \nBranch from giving effect to that designation.  See D. Ct. Doc. 13, at 1 (Feb. 12, 2025).3 \nThe government appealed the administrative stay to the D.C. Circuit, sought \n \n3  The district court stated that the President\u2019s designation of an Acting Special \nCounsel \u201cmay have been contrary to\u201d the court\u2019s order, App., infra, 29a n.8, but it was \nnot.  The order prohibited the government from \u201crecogniz[ing] the authority of any \nother person as Special Counsel.\u201d  D. Ct. 2/10/25 Minute Order.  The Executive \nBranch complied with that order, recognizing that, as long as it remains in effect, \nonly respondent may exercise \u201cauthority\u201d \u201cas Special Counsel.\u201d  Ibid.  The President\u2019s \ndesignation merely identifies the person who would take over the agency if and when \nthe court\u2019s order is lifted, the removal takes effect, and the official who had been ap-\npointed with the Senate\u2019s advice and consent is therefore \u201cunable to perform the func-\ntions and duties of the office.\u201d  5 U.S.C. 3345(a).  The Executive Branch takes seri-\nously its constitutional duty to comply with the orders of Article III courts, and it has \nfulfilled that duty here.  \n \n\n9 \na writ of mandamus, and sought a stay of the district court\u2019s order.  See App., infra, \n1a.  The court of appeals dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, denied manda-\nmus, and dismissed the motion for a stay.  See id. at 1a-2a.  In a concurring opinion, \nJudge Katsas indicated that the district court\u2019s administrative stay was not immedi-\nately appealable, but he emphasized that he \u201cexpress[ed] no view on the appealability \nor merits of any later order granting interim relief to [respondent].\u201d  Id. at 3a. \n3.  On February 12, the district court issued what it described as a tempo-\nrary restraining order.  See App., infra, 4a-30a.  The order stated that, \u201cuntil the \n[district court] rules on the entry of a preliminary injunction,\u201d respondent \u201cshall con-\ntinue to serve as the Special Counsel\u201d and applicants \u201cmay not deny him access to the \nresources or materials of that office or recognize the authority of any other person as \nSpecial Counsel.\u201d  Id. at 29a.   \nIn issuing that order, the district court found that respondent was likely to \nsucceed on the merits.  See App., infra, 11a-19a.  The court acknowledged this Court\u2019s \ndecisions recognizing \u201cthe President\u2019s broad authority to remove officials  * * *  at \nwill,\u201d but concluded that \u201cthe reasoning underlying the decisions  * * *  does not ex-\ntend to the unique office and official involved in this case.\u201d  Id. at 12a.  The court \nstated that the Office of Special Counsel \u201chas no authority over private actors,\u201d \u201cdoes \nnot have broad rulemaking authority or wield substantial enforcement authority,\u201d \nand does not affect \u201ca broad swath of the American public or economy.\u201d  Id. at 18a.  \nTurning to the equities, the district court accepted respondent\u2019s contention \nthat he faced irreparable harm because he was deprived of his \u201cstatutory entitlement \nto serve as the lawful agency head\u201d of the Office.  App., infra, 19a (citation omitted).  \nAnd it held that the balance of hardships and the public interest favored respondent \nbecause the government \u201cproferr[ed] no circumstances that required the President\u2019s \n \n\n10 \nhasty, unexplained action, or that would justify the immediate ejection of [respond-\nent] while the legal issue is subject to calm and thorough deliberation.\u201d  Id. at 28a.   \n3.  The same day, the government again appealed to the D.C. Circuit and \nsought a writ of mandamus.  See App., infra, 32a.  The next day, the district court \ndenied the government\u2019s motion for a stay pending appeal, emphasizing that its order \nwas one of \u201climited duration.\u201d  Ibid.; see id. at 31a-32a.  The court later issued an \norder consolidating the upcoming preliminary-injunction hearing with its considera-\ntion of the merits.  See D. Ct. 2/15/25 Minute Order. \nIn a lengthy opinion issued late at night on Saturday, February 15, the court \nof appeals once more dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, denied mandamus, \nand dismissed the motion for a stay.  See App., infra, 33a-59a.  The court reasoned \nthat \u201c[p]reliminary injunctions are appealable, but TROs generally are not.\u201d  App., \ninfra, 38a.  The court acknowledged that a TRO may be treated as an injunction when \nit has \u201cirreparable consequences that warrant immediate relief,\u201d but it determined \nthat the harm to the Executive Branch here does not qualify.  Id. at 38a-39a.  The \ncourt observed that the district court plans to hold a preliminary-injunction hearing \non February 26 and stated that \u201c[w]aiting two weeks\u201d to exercise \u201cthe Executive\u2019s \nArticle II prerogatives\u201d is \u201cnot so prejudicial to the government\u2019s interests that [the \ncourt] must rush to issue a ruling.\u201d  Id. at 41a.  \nJudge Katsas dissented.  See App., infra, 48a-59a.  He first explained that, \nalthough TROs \u201cgenerally are not\u201d appealable, \u201cthis TRO\u2014which orders the Presi-\ndent to recognize the authority of an agency head whom he has formally removed\u2014\nqualifies for immediate review.\u201d  Id. at 50a.  \u201cWhen it comes to judicial review,\u201d he \nnoted, \u201ccourts have long recognized the \u2018special status of the President.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 51a \n(citation omitted).  For instance, he cited opinions permitting immediate review of \n \n\n11 \norders compelling the President to produce subpoenaed documents, see United States \nv. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683 (1974); discovery orders against the Vice President, see Cheney \nv. United States District Court, 542 U.S. 367 (2007); and interlocutory orders rejecting \nas-applied Article II defenses to criminal prosecutions, see Trump v. United States, \n603 U.S. 593, 654 (Barrett, J., concurring).  App., infra, 51a-52a.  Judge Katsas con-\ncluded that the district court\u2019s TRO \u201cis immediately reviewable under these princi-\nples\u201d because it \u201cusurped a core Article II power of the President.\u201d  Id. at 53a.  \nARGUMENT \nUnder Rule 23 of the Rules of this Court and the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. 1651, \nthe Court may vacate a temporary restraining order entered by a federal district \ncourt.  See Brewer v. Landrigan, 562 U.S. 996 (2010); Brunner v. Ohio Republican \nParty, 555 U.S. 5, 6 (2008) (per curiam).  To obtain such relief, an applicant must \nshow a likelihood of success on the merits, a reasonable probability of obtaining cer-\ntiorari, and a likelihood of irreparable harm.  See Hollingsworth v. Perry, 558 U.S. \n183, 190 (2010) (per curiam).  In \u201cclose cases,\u201d \u201cthe Court will balance the equities \nand weigh the relative harms.\u201d  Ibid.  Those factors overwhelmingly support vacatur \nhere.4  \nA.  The Government Is Likely To Succeed On The Merits \nAn applicant\u2019s likelihood of success on the merits is the most important deter-\nminant for emergency relief\u2014and here, that likelihood is very high.   See Ohio v. \nEPA, 603 U.S. 279, 292 (2024); Labrador v. Poe, 144 S. Ct. 921, 929 (2024) (Ka-\n \n4  The government has applied to \u201cvacate\u201d rather than \u201cstay\u201d a district court\u2019s \norder when, given the order\u2019s duration, a stay pending review in this Court would \neffectively foreclose all applications of the order.  See, e.g., Appl. to Vacate Injunction \nat 15 n.3, Garland v. Blackhawk Manufacturing Group, Inc., 144 S. Ct. 338 (No. \n23A302).  Regardless of the label, the practical effect of the relief is the same, and the \ntraditional stay standard should govern.  See ibid.; see also Brunner, 555 U.S. at 5-6 \n(\u201cvaca[ting]\u201d a TRO even though the applicant had asked the Court to \u201cstay\u201d it).  \n \n\n12 \nvanaugh, J., concurring).  First, this Court\u2019s precedents are pellucid that Article II \nempowers the President to remove, at will, the single head of an agency, such as the \nSpecial Counsel.  See App., infra, 55a-56a (Katsas, J., dissenting).  Second, this \nCourt\u2019s precedents are clear that district courts lack equitable power to reinstate \nprincipal officers.  See id. at 54a-55a.  By transgressing both of those lines of prece-\ndent, the district court erred in ways that threaten the separation of powers. \n1.  Article  II  empowers  the  President  to  remove  the  Special \nCounsel at will  \na.  Time and again, this Court has held that the President has unrestricted \nremoval authority over principal officers such as respondent.  Article II vests the \u201cex-\necutive Power\u201d in the President and directs him to \u201ctake Care that the Laws be faith-\nfully executed.\u201d  U.S. Const. Art. II, \u00a7 1, Cl. 1; id. \u00a7 3.  The executive power \u201cgenerally \nincludes the ability to remove executive officials.\u201d  Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. \n197, 213 (2020).  Otherwise, \u201cthe President could not be held fully accountable for \ndischarging his own responsibilities; the buck would stop somewhere else.\u201d  Id. at 204 \n(citation omitted).  The President\u2019s power to remove those who exercise his executive \npower on his behalf \u201cfollows from the text of Article II,\u201d \u201cwas settled by the First \nCongress,\u201d and has been \u201cconfirmed\u201d by this Court many times.  Ibid.; Collins v. \nYellen, 594 U.S. 220, 250-256 (2021); Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 213-232; Free Enterprise \nFund v. PCAOB, 561 U.S. 477, 492-510 (2010); Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, \n108-176 (1926).  Thus, \u201cthe President\u2019s power to remove \u2018executive officers of the \nUnited States whom he has appointed\u2019 may not be regulated by Congress or reviewed \nby the courts.\u201d  Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593, 620 (2024) (citation omitted).   \nApplying that general rule, this Court has repeatedly held in recent years that \nthe President must be able to remove at will sole agency heads.  See Seila Law, 591 \n \n\n13 \nU.S. at 220-222.  As a general matter, the Constitution \u201cscrupulously avoids concen-\ntrating power in the hands of any single individual\u201d save for the President, who is \n\u201cthe most democratic and politically accountable official in Government.\u201d  Id. at 223-\n224.  Single agency heads thus must be accountable to the President through at-will \nremoval.  There are only four single agency heads upon whom Congress has sought \nto confer tenure protection:  the Directors of the Consumer Financial Protection Bu-\nreau (CFPB) and Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), the Commissioner of So-\ncial Security, and the Special Counsel here.  The former three are undisputedly sub-\nject to at-will removal under Article II.  This Court\u2019s precedents foreclose any special \nexception for the Special Counsel.   \nStart with the Director of the CFPB.  In Seila Law, this Court held that Con-\ngress had violated Article II by granting tenure protection to that sole agency head.  \nSee 591 U.S. at 220-232.  \u201cThe CFPB\u2019s single-Director structure contravene[d] [Arti-\ncle II\u2019s] carefully calibrated system by vesting significant governmental power in the \nhands of a single individual accountable to no one.\u201d  Id. at 224.  \u201cThe Director [wa]s \nneither elected by the people nor meaningfully controlled (through the threat of re-\nmoval) by someone who is.\u201d  Id. at 224-225.  \u201cWith no colleagues to persuade, and no \nboss or electorate looking over her shoulder,\u201d the Director could \u201cunilaterally\u201d \u201cdictate \nand enforce policy.\u201d  Id. at 225.   \nThis Court then extended the at-will-removal rule to the single head of the \nFHFA.  See Collins, 594 U.S. at 226-228.  The Court found Seila Law \u201call but dispos-\nitive,\u201d given that the FHFA was \u201can agency led by a single Director.\u201d  Id. at 250-251.  \nThe Court rejected the contention that the FHFA should be treated differently be-\ncause it exercised less executive power than the CFPB.  See id. at 251-253.  The Court \nexplained that \u201cthe nature and breadth of an agency\u2019s authority is not dispositive\u201d; \n \n\n14 \nthat \u201c[t]he President\u2019s removal power serves vital purposes even when the officer sub-\nject to removal is not the head of one of the largest and most powerful agencies\u201d; and \nthat \u201c[c]ourts are not well-suited to weigh the relative importance of the regulatory \nand enforcement authorities of disparate agencies.\u201d  Id. at 251-253.  In short, Article \nII empowers the President \u201cto remove the head of an agency with a single top officer.\u201d  \nId. at 256; see id. at 273 (Kagan, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judg-\nment) (\u201cAny \u2018agency led by a single Director,\u2019 no matter how much executive power it \nwields, now becomes subject to the requirement of at-will removal.\u201d); id. at 292 (So-\ntomayor, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\u201cAfter Seila Law, the Court \nreasons, all that matters is that \u2018the FHFA (like the CFPB) is an agency led by a \nsingle Director.\u2019\u200a\u201d) (brackets and citation omitted).   \nThen came the single head of the Social Security Administration.  After Col-\nlins, President Biden removed the Commissioner of Social Security without cause, \ncontrary to a statute purporting to make that agency head removable only for \u201cneglect \nof duty or malfeasance in office.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 902(a)(3).  In supporting that decision, \nthe Office of Legal Counsel explained that \u201cthe best reading of Collins and Seila Law\u201d \n\u201cmeans that the President need not heed the Commissioner\u2019s statutory tenure pro-\ntection.\u201d  Constitutionality of the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s Tenure Protection, \n2021 WL 2981542, at *1, *7 (July 8, 2021).  The only courts of appeals to have consid-\nered the question, the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits, have both held that statutory \nrestrictions on the removal of that single agency head violate Article II.  See Rodri-\nguez v. SSA, 118 F.4th 1302, 1313-1314 (11th Cir. 2024); Kaufmann v. Kijakazi, 32 \nF.4th 843, 848-849 (9th Cir. 2022).  \nb.  Crafting a special exception to at-will removal for the Special Counsel \nwould plainly contravene those precedents.  \u201c[T]he Special Counsel undoubtedly \n \n\n15 \nwields executive power.\u201d  App., infra, 56a (Katsas, J., dissenting).  The Office of Spe-\ncial Counsel is an \u201cinvestigative and prosecutorial agency\u201d responsible for executing \n\u201cfour federal laws\u201d:  \u201cthe Civil Service Reform Act, the Whistleblower Protection Act, \nthe Hatch Act, and the Uniformed Services Employment & Reemployment Rights \nAct.\u201d  https://osc.gov/Agency.  The Special Counsel may, among other things, \u201cinves-\ntigate allegations of prohibited personnel actions,\u201d 5 U.S.C. 1212(a)(2); \u201cinvestigat[e]\u201d \n\u201cany allegation\u201d concerning \u201cpolitical activity,\u201d \u201cactivities prohibited by any civil ser-\nvice law,\u201d or \u201cprohibited discrimination,\u201d 5 U.S.C. 1216(a); and \u201cissue subpoenas\u201d and \n\u201corder the taking of depositions,\u201d 5 U.S.C. 1212(b)(2).  The Special Counsel also en-\nforces multiple statutes by bringing disciplinary actions and litigating complaints be-\nfore the MSPB, see 5 U.S.C. 1215; intervening in proceedings before the MSPB, 5 \nU.S.C.  1212(c)(1);  and  litigating  in  federal  court  as  an  amicus  curiae,  5  U.S.C. \n1212(h)(1).  Further, the Special Counsel may appoint other officials in his agency, \nsee 5 U.S.C. 1212(d)(1), and issue regulations, see 5 U.S.C. 1212(e).   \nThose are executive functions\u2014and significant ones at that.  At the outset, the \nDepartment of Justice recognized that \u201cthe Special Counsel\u2019s functions are executive \nin character\u201d; that his powers \u201care directed at the enforcement of the laws\u201d; and that \nhis \u201crole in investigating and prosecuting prohibited practices is much the same as \nthat of a U.S. Attorney or other Federal prosecutors.\u201d  2 Op. O.L.C. 120, 120 (1978).  \nThe D.C. Circuit, for its part, has noted that the Special Counsel is a \u201cprosecutor  * * *  \nof merit system abuses\u201d who pursues administrative enforcement actions that are \n\u201ccomparable to criminal prosecutions designed to vindicate the public interest.\u201d  Fra-\nzier v. MSPB, 672 F.2d 150, 163 (1982) (emphasis omitted); see Barnhart v. Devine, \n771 F.2d 1515, 1520 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (describing the Special Counsel as the MSPB\u2019s \n\u201cprosecutorial arm\u201d).  The MSPB, too, has described the Special Counsel\u2019s relation-\n \n\n16 \nship to it as like \u201cthat of a prosecuting attorney to a court.\u201d  Layser v. USDA, 8 \nM.S.P.B. 72, 73 (1981).  Even the Office of Special Counsel agrees that it is an \u201cinves-\ntigatory and prosecutorial agency,\u201d https://osc.gov/Agency, that is located \u201cwithin the \nexecutive branch,\u201d OSC Annual Report 9.  But \u201c[i]nvestigative and prosecutorial de-\ncisionmaking is \u2018the special province of the Executive Branch,\u2019 and the Constitution \nvests the entirety of the executive power in the President.\u201d  Trump, 603 U.S. at 620 \n(citation omitted).     \nThus, the unconstitutionality of the Special Counsel\u2019s tenure protection has \nlong been apparent.  The Executive Branch has repeatedly objected to that protection \nsince the enactment of the Civil Service Reform Act in 1978.  During the Carter Ad-\nministration, the Department of Justice explained that, \u201c[b]ecause the Special Coun-\nsel [would] be performing largely executive functions, the Congress [could] not re-\nstrict the President\u2019s power to remove him.\u201d  2 Op. O.L.C. at 121; see Seila Law, 591 \nU.S. at 221 (noting that the statutory tenure provision elicited a \u201ccontemporaneous \nconstitutional objection\u201d).  In 1988, President Reagan pocket-vetoed a bill that would \nhave vested the Office of Special Counsel with additional powers, explaining that the \nlegislation \u201craised serious constitutional concerns\u201d by, among other things, \u201cpur-\nport[ing] to insulate the Office from presidential supervision and to limit the power \nof the President to remove his subordinates from office.\u201d  Public Papers of the Presi-\ndents, Ronald Reagan, Vol. II, Oct. 26, 1988, at 1391-1392 (1991); see Seila Law, 591 \nU.S. at 221 (noting that President Reagan vetoed the bill \u201con constitutional grounds\u201d).  \nAnd during the first Trump Administration, the Acting Solicitor General filed a brief \nin this Court explaining that, on the government\u2019s reading of this Court\u2019s precedents, \n\u201cthe President must have the power to remove at will the single heads of the Social \nSecurity Administration and Office of Special Counsel.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Reply & Response Br. \n \n\n17 \nat 26, Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (No. 19-422).  This is not a close call. \nc.  The district court\u2019s and court of appeals\u2019 contrary reasoning defies this \nCourt\u2019s precedents.   \nThe district court stated that \u201cthe reasoning underlying\u201d Seila Law and Collins \n\u201cdoes not extend to the unique office and official involved in this case\u201d and that the \nOffice of Special Counsel \u201ccannot be compared to those involved when [this] Court \nfound the removal for cause requirement to be an unconstitutional intrusion on Pres-\nidential power.\u201d  App., infra, 12a, 19a.  That analysis gets things backwards.  This \nCourt\u2019s precedents recognize a \u201cgeneral rule\u201d of \u201cunrestricted removal,\u201d subject to \nonly \u201ctwo exceptions.\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 215.  First, in Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. \nUnited States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), the Court concluded that Congress could provide \ntenure protection to \u201ca multimember body of experts, balanced along partisan lines, \nthat performed legislative and judicial functions and was said not to exercise any \nexecutive power.\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 216.5  Second, the Court has concluded that \nCongress could provide tenure protection to \u201ccertain inferior officers with narrowly \ndefined duties.\u201d  Id. at 204 (citing Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988), and United \nStates v. Perkins, 116 U.S. 483 (1886)).  Those two exceptions represent \u201cthe outer-\nmost constitutional limits of permissible congressional restrictions on the President\u2019s \nremoval power.\u201d  Id. at 218 (citation omitted). \nThe district court should not have asked whether the cases applying that gen-\n \n5  Humphrey\u2019s Executor appears to have misapprehended the powers of \u201cthe \nNew Deal-era [Federal Trade Commission]\u201d and misclassified those powers as pri-\nmarily legislative and judicial.  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 218.  The exception recognized \nin Humphrey\u2019s Executor thus does not apply to multimember agencies that exercise \nsubstantial executive power, for instance by promulgating binding rules or issuing \nfinal decisions in administrative adjudications.  The Department of Justice has in-\nformed Congress that, to the extent Humphrey\u2019s Executor requires otherwise, it in-\ntends to urge this Court to overrule that decision.  See https://www.justice.gov/oip/ \nmedia/1389526/dl?inline. \n \n\n18 \neral rule, such as Seila Law and Collins, should be \u201cextend[ed]\u201d to the Special Coun-\nsel.  App., infra, 12a.  Rather, it should have recognized the rule that the President \ncan remove principal officers at will and noted that this Court has foreclosed any \npossible exception for single agency heads.  That should have ended the matter, es-\npecially since the only exceptions this Court has recognized to the President\u2019s unre-\nstricted removal power are inapt.  As the district court acknowledged, the Special \nCounsel \u201cis not entirely analogous\u201d to the \u201cFTC panel members\u201d in Humphrey\u2019s Ex-\necutor or the \u201cIndependent Counsel\u201d in Morrison.  App., infra, 15a-16a.  \nRegardless, \u201cthe reasoning underlying\u201d this Court\u2019s recent precedents does \u201cex-\ntend\u201d to this case.  App., infra, 12a.  Those precedents establish a bright-line rule:  \n\u201c[T]he Constitution prohibits even \u2018modest restrictions\u2019 on the President\u2019s power to \nremove the head of an agency with a single top officer.\u201d  Collins, 594 U.S. at 256 \n(citation omitted).  The district court dismissed Seila Law and Collins on the ground \nthat the Special Counsel exercises \u201climited jurisdiction,\u201d deals with \u201ca small subset\u201d \nof federal employees, \u201cdoes not have broad rulemaking authority or wield substantial \nenforcement authority,\u201d and does not \u201caffec[t] a broad swath of the American public \nor its economy.\u201d  App., infra, 18a.  But Collins refutes that rationale, making clear \nthat the President\u2019s power to remove sole agency heads does not \u201ching[e] on\u201d \u201cthe \nrelative importance of the regulatory and enforcement authority of disparate agen-\ncies.\u201d  594 U.S. at 253.  Article II contains no exception for \u201climited\u201d exercises of ex-\necutive power that purportedly affect only \u201csmall\u201d groups of people.  App., infra, 18a; \ncf. Morrison, 487 U.S. at 718 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe Ambassador to Luxembourg \nis not anything less than a principal [executive] officer, simply because Luxembourg \nis small.\u201d).  And the Special Counsel executes multiple federal laws by investigating \nallegations of wrongdoing, issuing subpoenas, bringing disciplinary actions, and par-\n \n\n19 \nticipating in proceedings before the Merit Systems Protection Board.  \nThe district court emphasized that, in Seila Law and Collins, this Court did \n\u201cnot comment on the constitutionality of any removal restriction\u201d applicable to other \nagencies that were not before the Court.  App., infra, 17a (quoting Collins, 594 U.S. \nat 256 n.21).  \u201cBut a court, by announcing that its decision is confined to the facts \nbefore it, does not decide in advance that logic will not drive it further when new facts \narise.\u201d  Haddock v. Haddock, 201 U.S. 562, 631 (1906) (Holmes, J., dissenting).  The \nresults in Seila Law and Collins may have concerned only the CFPB and FHFA, but \nthe Court\u2019s reasoning \u201cis all but dispositive\u201d for any other \u201cagency led by a single \nDirector.\u201d  Collins, 594 U.S. at 250-251.   \nThe district court also analogized the Special Counsel to the Independent \nCounsel, whose removal protections were sustained in Morrison.  App., infra, 14a.  \nBut Morrison concerned an inferior officer appointed by a court of law, not a principal \nofficer appointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate to lead \na freestanding executive department.  Because the Special Counsel \u201cis not an inferior \nofficer,\u201d \u201c[t]he logic of Morrison  * * *  does not apply.\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 219.   \nThe district court noted that Presidents Carter and George H.W. Bush signed \nthe bills that give the Office of Special Counsel its current structure.  See App., infra, \n16a n.3.  But \u201cit is not uncommon for Presidents to approve legislation containing \nparts which are objectionable on constitutional grounds.\u201d  INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. \n919, 942 n.13 (1983).  The court added that, when concluding that President Biden \ncould fire the Commissioner of Social Security at will, the Office of Legal Counsel \n\u201cd[id] not reach the validity of tenure protections conferred on the Special Counsel.\u201d  \n2021 WL 2981542, at *6 n.3; see App., infra, 18a n.4.  But that 2021 legal opinion \nsimply stated that the Office of Special Counsel would \u201cimplicate different consider-\n \n\n20 \nations,\u201d mentioning its \u201cprimarily investigatory function and \u2018limited jurisdiction.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \n2021 WL 2981542, at *15 (citation omitted).  That opinion did not mention the pros-\necutorial functions, much less disavow the Office of Legal Counsel\u2019s prior determina-\ntion that, \u201c[b]ecause the Special Counsel [would] be performing largely executive \nfunctions, the Congress [could] not restrict the President\u2019s power to remove him.\u201d  2 \nOp. O.L.C. at 122.  Regardless, one President cannot \u201cbind his successors by dimin-\nishing their powers.\u201d  Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 497. \nThe district court\u2019s decision reasons that the needs of \u201cthe unique office and \nofficial involved in this case,\u201d App., infra, 12a, justify recognizing a new exception to \nthe \u201cgeneral rule\u201d of \u201cunrestricted removal,\u201d Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 215.  But this \nCourt has held the opposite many times, has cabined the \u201ctwo exceptions to the Pres-\nident\u2019s unrestricted removal power\u201d as representing \u201c\u200a\u2018the outermost constitutional \nlimits of permissible congressional restrictions\u2019\u200a\u201d on removal, and has warned against \nextending those exceptions to \u201cnovel context[s].\u201d  Id. at 204, 218 (citation omitted).    \nThe court of appeals, for its part, did not explore the merits, but did invoke the \npresumption of constitutionality that ordinarily attaches to a \u201cduly enacted statute.\u201d  \nApp., infra, 41a (citing Rostker v. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57, 64 (1981)).  This Court has \nnever invoked that presumption in inter-branch disputes concerning the removal \npower, \u201cbecause it does not apply.\u201d  Morrison, 487 U.S. at 704 (Scalia, J., dissenting) \n(emphasis in original).  \u201c[W]here the issue pertains to the separation of powers, and \nthe political branches are (as here) in disagreement, neither can be presumed cor-\nrect.\u201d  Id. at 704-705.  \u201cThe reason is stated concisely by Madison:  \u2018The several de-\npartments being perfectly co-ordinate by the terms of their common commission, nei-\nther of them, it is evident, can pretend to an exclusive or superior right of settling the \nboundaries between their respective powers.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 705 (citation omitted).  \u201cThe \n \n\n21 \nplaying field for the present case, in other words, is a level one.  As one of the inter-\nested and coordinate parties to the underlying dispute, Congress, no more than the \nPresident, is entitled to the benefit of the doubt.\u201d  Ibid. \nd.  Worse, the district court\u2019s order does not just enjoin the President from \nfiring the Special Counsel.  The court\u2019s order strips the President of even the author-\nity under the statute to remove the Special Counsel \u201cfor inefficiency, neglect of duty, \nor malfeasance in office.\u201d  5 U.S.C. 1211(b).  The court\u2019s order provides categorically \nthat, \u201cuntil the Court rules on the entry of a preliminary injunction, plaintiff Hamp-\nton Dellinger shall continue to serve as the Special Counsel.\u201d  App., infra, 29a.   \nThe district court\u2019s order thus raises the prospect that, even if the President \nwished to fire respondent for cause (i.e., in conformity with the statute\u2019s restriction \non his removal power), he would first need to ask the court to modify its order.  The \ncourt of appeals appeared to view that prospect with equanimity, stating that the \norder is not \u201cirreversible\u201d and that \u201cthe district court can  * * *  allow the President \nto remove Dellinger, if the court so chooses.\u201d  App., infra, 44a.  But that demand for \njudicial preclearance represents a further and unprecedented intrusion on presiden-\ntial oversight of the Executive Branch.  The First Congress rejected the idea that the \nPresident would need to obtain the Senate\u2019s advice and consent to remove a principal \nexecutive officer.  See Myers, 272 U.S. at 115.  No one imagined that the President \nmight need to obtain the advice and consent of a federal district court.   \n2.  Respondent has no right to reinstatement \nHaving contravened this Court\u2019s removal precedents, the district court defied \nthe Court\u2019s remedial precedents as well.  Courts cannot enjoin the President\u2014yet the \ndistrict court\u2019s order here requires undoing the President\u2019s removal decision and bars \nthe President from appointing anyone else.  This Court recognized long ago that a \n \n\n22 \ncourt \u201chas no jurisdiction of a bill to enjoin the President in the performance of his \nofficial duties.\u201d  Mississippi v. Johnson, 4 Wall. 475, 501 (1867); see Franklin v. Mas-\nsachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 826-828 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring \nin the judgment).  \u201cAn injunction preventing the President from firing an agency \nhead\u2014and thus controlling how he performs his official duties\u2014is virtually unheard \nof.\u201d  App., infra, at 54a (Katsas, J., dissenting).  Yet the district court\u2019s order neces-\nsarily enjoins the President from removing the Special Counsel or from appointing \nsomeone else by directing that \u201cDellinger shall continue to serve as the Special Coun-\nsel\u201d and that \u201cDefendants may not  * * *  recognize the authority of any other person \nas Special Counsel.\u201d  App., infra, 29a.  The court of appeals sought to avoid that prob-\nlem by interpreting the term \u201cDefendants\u201d to refer only to \u201cthe other defendants\u201d but \nnot to the President himself.  Id. at 42a n.1.  But that is no answer.  \u201c[T]he TRO \nnecessarily targets the President\u2014the only official with the statutory and constitu-\ntional authority to appoint, remove, and supervise the Special Counsel.\u201d  Id. at 53a \nn.2 (Katsas, J., dissenting). \nWhether the order is expressly directed at the President or not, this Court\u2019s \nprecedents reinforce that courts lack power to issue any order reinstating a principal \nexecutive officer removed by the President.  When executive officers have challenged \ntheir removal by the President, they have traditionally sought back pay, not rein-\nstatement.  See Wiener v. United States, 357 U.S. 349, 350 (1958) (suit \u201cfor recovery \nof his salary\u201d); Humphrey\u2019s Executor, 295 U.S. at 612 (suit \u201cto recover a sum of money \nalleged to be due  * * *  for salary\u201d); Myers, 272 U.S. at 106 (suit \u201cfor his salary from \nthe date of removal\u201d); Shurtleff v. United States, 189 U.S. 311, 318 (1903) (suit \u201cfor \nsalary\u201d); Parsons v. United States, 167 U.S. 324, 326 (1896) (suit \u201cfor salary and fees\u201d).   \nThat rule reflects the obvious Article II problems that arise if a court attempts \n \n\n23 \nto reinstate a principal executive officer removed by the President.  The President \ncannot be compelled to retain the services of a principal officer whom he no longer \nbelieves should be entrusted with the exercise of executive power.  Indeed, many \nmembers of the First Congress argued against requiring the Senate\u2019s advice and con-\nsent for removals precisely because of the risk that such a procedure would require \nthe President to retain someone he had sought to remove.  As Representative Benson \nobserved:  \u201cIf the Senate, upon its meeting, were to acquit the officer, and replace him \nin his station, the President would then have a man forced on him whom he consid-\nered as unfaithful.\u201d  Myers, 272 U.S. at 124 (citation omitted).  Representative Bou-\ndinot argued:  \u201cBut suppose [the Senate] shall decide in favor of the officer, what a \nsituation is the President then in, surrounded by officers with whom, by his situation, \nhe is compelled to act, but in whom he can have no confidence.\u201d  Id. at 131-132 (cita-\ntion omitted).  And Representative Sedwick asked rhetorically:  \u201cShall a man under \nthese circumstances be saddled upon the President, who has been appointed for no \nother purpose but to aid the President in performing certain duties?  Shall he be con-\ntinued, I ask again, against the will of the President?\u201d  Id. at 132 (citation omitted).  \nThe district court\u2019s extraordinary remedy raises just that problem. \nThe district court\u2019s remedy also exceeded the scope of its equitable powers.  A \nfederal court may grant only those equitable remedies that were \u201ctraditionally ac-\ncorded by courts of equity.\u201d  Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo S.A. v. Alliance Bond \nFund, Inc., 527 U.S. 308, 319 (1999).  Reinstatement of a public official is not such a \nremedy.  \u201c[I]t is  * * *  well settled that a court of equity has no jurisdiction over the \nappointment and removal of public officers.\u201d  In re Sawyer, 124 U.S. 200, 212 (1888).  \nInstead, \u201c[t]he jurisdiction to determine the title to a public office belongs exclusively \nto the courts of law,\u201d for instance through suits for back pay.  Ibid.  Thus, \u201cthe power \n \n\n24 \nof a court of equity to restrain by injunction the removal of a [public] officer has been \ndenied in many well-considered cases.\u201d  Ibid.; see, e.g., Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, \n231 (1962) (decisions that \u201cheld that federal equity power could not be exercised to \nenjoin a state proceeding to remove a public officer\u201d or that \u201cwithheld federal equity \nfrom staying removal of a federal officer\u201d reflect \u201ca traditional limit upon equity ju-\nrisdiction\u201d); Walton v. House of Representatives, 265 U.S. 487, 490 (1924) (\u201cA court of \nequity has no jurisdiction over the appointment and removal of public officers.\u201d); \nHarkrader v. Wadley, 172 U.S. 148, 165 (1898) (\u201c[T]o sustain a bill in equity to re-\nstrain  * * *  the removal of public officers, is to invade the domain of the courts of \ncommon law, or of the executive and administrative department of the government.\u201d); \nWhite v. Berry, 171 U.S. 366, 377 (1898) (\u201c[A] court of equity will not, by injunction, \nrestrain an executive officer from making a wrongful removal of a subordinate ap-\npointee, nor restrain the appointment of another.\u201d).  \nTo be sure, Congress has sometimes departed from that equitable tradition and \nhas empowered courts to award reinstatement.  For instance, Title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-5(g), empowers courts to grant \u201creinstatement\u201d \nas well as \u201cback pay\u201d as remedies for employment discrimination.  Ibid.  Respondent, \nhowever, cites no statute that authorizes a court to reinstate a Special Counsel who \nclaims to have been wrongfully removed.  A court accordingly may not grant such a \nremedy.  The creation of new remedies is \u201ca legislative endeavor,\u201d Egbert v. Boule, \n596 U.S. 482, 491 (2022), and courts of equity lack \u201cthe power to create remedies \npreviously unknown to equity jurisprudence,\u201d Grupo Mexicano, 527 U.S. at 332.   \nThose principles apply even to \u201cthe removal of a municipal officer,\u201d Sawyer, 124 U.S. \nat 212, and apply all the more to the President\u2019s removal of principal executive officer.    \n\u201cPerhaps the most telling indication of the severe constitutional problem with \n \n\n25 \nthe [district court\u2019s remedy] is the lack of historical precedent for [it].\u201d  Free Enterprise \nFund, 561 U.S. at 505 (citation omitted).  We are unaware of any previous case in \nwhich a court ordered the reinstatement of single agency head after removal by the \nPresident.  At most, a district court in 1983 effectively reinstated removed members \nof the multimember U.S. Commission on Civil Rights because that court believed that \nthe commission functioned as a \u201clegislative agency\u201d whose \u201c\u200a\u2018only purpose\u2019\u200a\u201d was \u201cto \nfind facts which [could] subsequently be used as a basis for legislative or executive \naction\u201d\u2014not to exercise any executive power in its own right.  Barry v. Reagan, No. \n83-cv-3182, 1983 WL 538, at *2 (D.D.C. Nov. 14, 1983).  That is no support for the \ndistrict court\u2019s unheard-of decision to seize control of an executive agency from the \nPresident and insist that an agency head whom the President has fired must keep \nexercising Article II powers.  \nB.  The Other Factors Support Relief From The District Court\u2019s Order \nIn  deciding  whether  to  grant  emergency  relief,  this  Court  also  considers \nwhether the underlying issues warrant its review, whether the applicant likely faces \nirreparable harm, and, in close cases, the balance of equities.  See Hollingsworth, 558 \nU.S. at 190.  Those factors overwhelmingly support relief here.   \n1.  The issues raised by this case warrant this Court\u2019s review \nPlainly, if the court of appeals holds that the President may not remove the \nSpecial Counsel at will or that the district court may order the reinstatement of the \nSpecial Counsel, that decision would warrant this Court\u2019s review.  The Court has on \nseveral occasions granted certiorari to review the constitutionality of restrictions on \nthe President\u2019s power to remove executive officials.  See Collins, 594 U.S. at 236; Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 209; Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 488.  Rightly so.  The Court \nhas recognized \u201cthe importance of removal as a tool of supervision,\u201d identifying it as \n \n\n26 \n\u201cthe key means\u201d of preserving the Executive Branch\u2019s \u201c\u200a\u2018dependence on the people.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nFree Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 501 (citation omitted).  \u201c[T]he expansion of [the \nfederal] bureaucracy into new territories the Framers could scarcely have imagined \nonly sharpens [the Court\u2019s] duty to ensure that the Executive Branch is overseen by \na President accountable to the people.\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 231-232.   \nFurther, this Court has been appropriately receptive to reviewing cases where, \nas here, \u201c[t]he Executive Branch, at its highest level, is seeking the aid of the courts \nto protect its constitutional prerogatives.\u201d  Cheney v. United States District Court, 542 \nU.S. 367, 385 (2004); see, e.g., Clinton v. Jones, 520 U.S. 681, 689-690 (1997) (\u201cThe \nrepresentations made on behalf of the Executive Branch as to the potential impact of \nthe precedent established by the Court of Appeals merit our respectful and deliberate \nconsideration.\u201d).  The President has sought to remove an agency head, only to be \nthwarted by a district court.  \n2.  The  district  court\u2019s  reinstatement  of  the  Special  Counsel \ncauses irreparable harm to the Executive Branch \na.  The district court\u2019s order causes extraordinary and irreparable harm to \nthe President, in whom the Constitution vests \u201call of\u200a\u201d \u201cthe \u2018executive Power.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Seila \nLaw, 590 U.S. at 203 (quoting Art. II, \u00a7 1, Cl. 1).  A single district judge is forcing the \nPresident to continue allowing a principal officer to exercise executive power when \nthe President believes that the officer should be removed.  That sort of harm\u2014to the \nExecutive Branch, to the separation of powers, and to our democratic system\u2014is \ntransparently irreparable.  In the first few weeks of a new Administration, the Pres-\nident is being prevented from installing an agency head of the President\u2019s choosing \nto implement his agenda, and the President must instead retain an agency head \nagainst his will.  Not only can the district-court-reinstated agency head exercise ex-\n \n\n27 \necutive power without proper accountability to the President\u2014without, for instance, \nthe threat of removal for unwise enforcement or investigative decisions or rule-\nmakings.  Agency heads also control hiring and firing decisions for subordinates\u2014\nhere, an agency of over 100 people who perform important investigative and enforce-\nment functions affecting the entire federal workforce.  The President\u2019s lost ability to \nimplement his agenda through a principal officer of his choosing is plainly irreparable \nharm, as is the affront to his Article II powers.   \nThe district court faulted the government for failing to identify \u201ccircumstances \nthat required the President\u2019s hasty, unexplained action, or that would justify the im-\nmediate ejection of the Senate-confirmed Special Counsel.\u201d  App., infra, 28a.  That \nreasoning just attacks the notion of removal at will.  Presidents may remove execu-\ntive officers for many reasons:  to remove \u201cthose he finds \u2018negligent and inefficient,\u2019\u200a\u201d \n\u201cthose who exercise their discretion in a way that is not \u2018intelligent or wise,\u2019\u200a\u201d \u201cthose \nwho have \u2018different views of policy,\u201d \u201cthose who come from a competing political \nparty,\u201d and \u201cthose in whom he has  * * *  lost confidence.\u201d  Collins, 594 U.S. at 256 \n(brackets and citation omitted).  Presidents may remove executive officers simply be-\ncause they want to appoint someone else.  \u201c[T]he President\u2019s power to remove \u2018execu-\ntive officers of the United States\u2019 may not be regulated by Congress or reviewed by \nthe courts.\u201d  Trump, 603 U.S. at 621 (emphasis added; citation omitted).  \u201c[I]n cases \nin which the executive possesses a constitutional or legal discretion, nothing can be \nmore perfectly clear than that [his] acts are only politically examinable.\u201d  Marbury v. \nMadison, 1 Cranch 137, 166 (1803). \nThe district court believed that the Executive Branch did not face significant \nharm because the Office of Special Counsel has a \u201cnarrow focus.\u201d  App., infra, 28a.  \nBut the court understated the extent of the Special Counsel\u2019s powers.  As noted, the \n \n\n28 \nSpecial Counsel may appoint personnel, promulgate regulations, launch investiga-\ntions, issue subpoenas, bring disciplinary actions, and represent the Executive in pro-\nceedings in court and before the Merit Systems Protection Board.  Because of the \ncourt\u2019s order, the Special Counsel may now exercise all those powers \u201cwith no boss, \npeers, or voters to report to.\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 203.  More fundamentally, \u201c[i]t \nis not for [this Court] to determine, and [the Court has] never presumed to determine, \nhow much of the purely executive powers of government must be within the full con-\ntrol of the President.  The Constitution prescribes that they all are.\u201d  Morrison, 487 \nU.S. at 709 (Scalia, J., dissenting). \nFinally, the district court emphasized the \u201climited duration\u201d of its order\u2014\nwhich is set to expire on February 26, 2025\u2014and stated that applicants \u201chave not \nidentified any harms to themselves or the public that could flow from the Special \nCounsel\u2019s continuing to perform his statutory duty\u201d in the meantime.  App., infra, \n32a.  The court of appeals similarly thought that \u201c[w]aiting two weeks\u201d to exercise \n\u201cthe Executive\u2019s Article II prerogative\u201d is \u201cnot so prejudicial to the government\u2019s in-\nterests.\u201d  Id. at 41a.  That rationale ignores the direct harm that the court\u2019s order \ncauses to the Constitution\u2019s means of ensuring democratic accountability.  \u201c[T]he \nPresident is elected for four years, with the mandate of the people to exercise his \nexecutive power under the Constitution.\u201d  Myers, 272 U.S. at 123.  Yet in this case, a \ncourt has barred the elected President from controlling an entire department of the \nExecutive Branch and has turned over that department to a person who answers to \nno one and for whom no one voted.  That action raises grave issues of democratic \nlegitimacy and electoral accountability, issues not adequately answered by noting the \norder\u2019s \u201climited duration.\u201d  App., infra, 32a.  No one would seriously contend that a \ndistrict court\u2019s temporary restraining order enjoining the President from issuing a \n \n\n29 \npardon, making a nomination, or recognizing a foreign sovereign was tolerable simply \nbecause the court stymied the President for only two weeks.  So too here. \nIndeed, history and precedent underscore the President\u2019s and the Nation\u2019s in-\nterest in the prompt execution of removals.  \u201cThe Framers deemed an energetic exec-\nutive essential to \u2018the protection of the community against foreign attacks,\u2019 \u2018the \nsteady administration of the laws, \u2018the protection of property,\u2019 and \u2018the security of \nliberty.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 223-224 (citation omitted).  \u201cAccordingly, they chose \nnot to bog the Executive down with the \u2018habitual feebleness and dilatoriness\u2019 that \ncomes with a \u2018diversity of views and opinions.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 224 (citation omitted).  \u201cInstead, \nthey gave the Executive the \u2018decision, activity, secrecy, and dispatch\u2019 that \u2018character-\nise the proceedings of one man.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted). \nConsistent with that history, this Court has recognized that \u201csudden removals\u201d \nare sometimes \u201cnecessary.\u201d  United States v. Germaine, 99 U.S. 508, 510 (1879).  \u201cThe \nmoment that [the President] loses confidence in the intelligence, ability, judgment or \nloyalty of any one of [his subordinates], he must have the power to remove him with-\nout delay.\u201d  Myers, 272 U.S. at 134.  In Myers, the Court cited the prospect of delay as \none of the reasons for holding that Congress could not require the Senate\u2019s consent \nfor a removal:  \u201cTo require [the President] to file charges and submit them to the \nconsideration of the Senate might make impossible that unity and co-ordination in \nexecutive administration essential to effective action.\u201d  Ibid.  The Court\u2019s precedents \nforeclose the district court\u2019s suggestion that limits on the removal power are made \ntolerable by their \u201climited duration.\u201d  App., infra, 32a. \nb.  The district court\u2019s order also threatens irreparable harm to the Office \nof Special Counsel.  In Collins, this Court recognized that private parties may be en-\ntitled to a remedy when an unconstitutional removal restriction \u201cinflict[s] compensa-\n \n\n30 \nble harm.\u201d  594 U.S. at 259.  For instance, if \u201cthe President had attempted to remove \n[an agency head] but was prevented from doing so by a lower court decision,\u201d the \nremoval restriction \u201cwould clearly cause harm\u201d to affected individuals.  Ibid.  By \nthwarting the President\u2019s removal of the Special Counsel, the district court has argu-\nably exposed every action (or decision not to act) by the Office to legal challenge.  The \nprospect of mass invalidation of everything done by the Office during respondent\u2019s \ncourt-ordered and insulated tenure provides a further reason to grant immediate re-\nlief.  And that prospect vitiates the court\u2019s claim that its order is necessary to avoid \n\u201ca gap in protections\u201d provided by the Office.  App., infra, 27a (citation omitted).   \n3.  Granting relief would not prejudice respondent \nGranting the government relief from the district court\u2019s order would not cause \nany irreparable harm to respondent.  Although respondent\u2019s removal deprives him of \nhis employment and salary, such consequences ordinarily do not amount to irrepara-\nble injury, \u201chowever severely they may affect a particular individual.\u201d  Sampson v. \nMurray, 415 U.S. 61, 92 n.68 (1974).  Thus, the traditional remedy for such claims \nhas been an award of back pay at the end of the case, not interim reinstatement.  See \nApp., infra, 58a (Katsas, J., dissenting).  \nThe district court determined that respondent\u2019s removal irreparably harms \nhim by depriving him of \u201cthe ability to perform his statutory functions and fulfill his \nstatutory obligations.\u201d  App., infra, 27a.  But this Court has rejected that reasoning \ntoo.  Although a public official\u2019s \u201closs of salary\u201d amounts to a judicially cognizable \nharm, his \u201closs of political power\u201d does not.  Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811, 820 (1997).  \nThe notion that public officials \u201chave a separate private right, akin to a property in-\nterest, in the powers of their offices\u201d is \u201calien to the concept of a republican form of \ngovernment.\u201d  Barnes v. Kline, 759 F.2d 21, 50 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (Bork, J., dissenting).  \n \n\n31 \nAt bottom, respondent\u2019s claim to irreparable injury from being unable to continue to \nwield executive power is precisely the problem.  Executive power belongs to the Pres-\nident, not to respondent, and wresting control of that power from the President is \nconstitutionally intolerable.     \nC.  No Jurisdictional Or Prudential Obstacle Prevents This Court From \nGranting Relief \n1.  Respondent argued below that the court of appeals lacked jurisdiction \nto hear the government\u2019s appeal and so lacked power to grant relief from the district \ncourt\u2019s order.  See App., infra, 33a.  That contention is meritless; in all events, there \nis no obstacle to this Court\u2019s granting this application.  \nFirst, whatever the scope of the court of appeals\u2019 jurisdiction, the All Writs Act \nempowers this Court to grant relief.  That statute authorizes this Court to review a \nlower court\u2019s interlocutory orders.  See, e.g., United States Alkali Export Ass\u2019n v. \nUnited States, 325 U.S. 196, 201-204 (1945).  It also authorizes the Court to vacate or \nstay such orders.  See Coleman v. Paccar, Inc., 424 U.S. 1301, 1303 (1976) (Rehnquist, \nJ., in chambers).  Exercising that authority, the Court has previously entertained and \ngranted applications to vacate or stay TROs.  See Brewer, 562 U.S. at 996; Brunner, \n555 U.S. at 5-6.  \nSecond, the court of appeals had jurisdiction over the government\u2019s appeal \nfrom the district court\u2019s order.  In 28 U.S.C. 1292(a)(1), Congress granted the courts \nof appeals jurisdiction over appeals from orders granting \u201cinjunctions.\u201d  The district \ncourt, to be sure, labeled its order as a temporary restraining order rather than as an \ninjunction, but \u201cthe label attached to an order is not dispositive.\u201d  Abbott v. Perez, 585 \nU.S. 579, 594 (2018).  \u201c[W]here an order has the \u2018practical effect\u2019 of granting or deny-\ning an injunction, it should be treated as such for purposes of appellate jurisdiction.\u201d  \n \n\n32 \nIbid.  \u201cThis \u2018practical effect\u2019 rule serves a valuable purpose.  If an interlocutory in-\njunction is improperly granted or denied, much harm can occur before the final deci-\nsion of the district court.\u201d  Ibid.  Accordingly, \u201cCongress authorized interlocutory ap-\npellate review of such orders.  But if the availability of interlocutory review depended \non the district court\u2019s use of the term \u2018injunction\u2019 or some other particular language, \nCongress\u2019s scheme could be frustrated.\u201d  Ibid.; see Sampson, 415 U.S. at 86-87 (ex-\nplaining that a district court cannot \u201cshield its orders from appellate review merely \nby designating them as temporary restraining orders\u201d). \nThe district court\u2019s order, although labeled a TRO, is the practical equivalent \nof a preliminary injunction.  The court issued that order after having already issued \nan \u201cadministrative stay,\u201d which respondent has conceded was itself effectively a TRO.  \nSee No. 25-5025 Resp. C.A. Opp. 11, 13.  The court received adversarial briefing be-\nfore issuing the order\u2014which was sufficiently extensive that the court invited the \nparties to \u201cdeem the motion in support of the temporary restraining order to be a \nmemorandum in support of a motion for preliminary injunction, with the opposition \nand reply similarly designated.\u201d  App., infra, 30a.  And the court\u2019s order causes ex-\ntraordinary harm to the President\u2019s authority to oversee the Executive Branch.  See, \ne.g., Carson v. American Brands, Inc., 450 U.S. 79, 84 (1981) (an order may be more \nappropriately characterized as a preliminary injunction when it has \u201cserious, perhaps \nirreparable, consequence[s]\u201d) (citation omitted).   \nThis case, moreover, involves the President.  The President\u2014or, in some cases, \nthe Vice President or a former President\u2014is often able to obtain \u201cimmediate appellate \nreview\u201d that would be unavailable to ordinary litigants.  App., infra, 51a (Katsas, J., \ndissenting); see, e.g., Trump, 603 U.S. at 605 (reviewing ruling on presidential im-\nmunity from criminal prosecution); Cheney, 542 U.S. at 385 (reviewing discovery or-\n \n\n33 \nder against Vice President); Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731, 741-743 (1982) (re-\nviewing ruling on presidential immunity from civil prosecution).  This Court\u2019s \u201cprec-\nedent\u201d thus recognizes that \u201cinterlocutory review\u201d is sometimes \u201cnecessary to safe-\nguard important constitutional interests\u2014here, Executive Branch independence on \nmatters that Article II assigns to the President\u2019s discretion.\u201d  Trump, 603 U.S. at 651 \n(Barrett, J., concurring in part).  Consistent with those principles, the Court should \n\u201cview the order at issue here as a preliminary injunction.\u201d  Sampson, 415 U.S. at 88; \nsee App., infra, 51a-53a (Katsas, J., dissenting). \nFinally, the government asked the court of appeals, in the alternative, for a \nwrit of mandamus.  See App., infra, 33a.  The district court\u2019s extraordinary order \nreadily satisfies the standard for that relief.  See Cheney, 542 U.S. at 380-381.  If it \nwas proper to treat the district court\u2019s order as an unappealable TRO, the government \nwould have \u201cno other adequate means to attain the relief [it] desires.\u201d  Id. at 380 \n(citation omitted).  Given the clarity of the Constitution and this Court\u2019s precedents, \nthe government\u2019s right to relief is also \u201cclear and indisputable.\u201d  Id. at 381 (citation \nomitted).  And mandamus is \u201cappropriate under the circumstances\u201d because the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s actions \u201cthreaten the separation of powers.\u201d  Ibid.   \n2.  The court of appeals also raised prudential concerns about setting a \n\u201cprecedent\u201d that would encourage \u201cmany litigants subject to TROs  * * *  to appeal \nand to seek a stay,\u201d forcing courts to act \u201cat breakneck pace\u201d and \u201cscrambling the \nnormal appellate process.\u201d  App., infra, 41a.  We are mindful of those concerns, but \nthey do not justify leaving the district court\u2019s order in place.  \nThis case involves an order that runs against the President, and the President \nis not \u201cmany litigants.\u201d  App., infra, 41a.  Chief Justice Marshall long ago explained \nthat \u201c[i]n no case  * * *  would a court be required to proceed against the [P]resident \n \n\n34 \nas against an ordinary individual.\u201d  United States v. Burr, 25 F. Cas. 187, 192 (C.C. \nVa. 1807).  Not only that, the order trenches on two of the President\u2019s \u201cconclusive and \npreclusive\u201d powers\u2014the power to remove and the power to oversee investigations and \nprosecutions.  Trump, 603 U.S. at 607 (citation omitted).  Those powers lie at the core \nof the President\u2019s Article II prerogatives:  \u201cCongress cannot act on, and courts cannot \nexamine, the President\u2019s actions within his \u2018conclusive and preclusive\u2019 constitutional \nauthority.\u201d  Id. at 609.  Those distinctive circumstances\u2014which will not be present \nin cases involving ordinary litigants\u2014justify this Court\u2019s immediate intervention. \nThe government\u2019s response to the TROs issued so far in this Administration \nunderscores the distinctiveness of this case.  As noted above, in the weeks since the \nPresident\u2019s current term began, district courts have issued multiple TROs that block \nthe President\u2019s policies throughout the Nation, sometimes even throughout the world.  \nAlthough the government firmly believes that those TROs exceed district courts\u2019 law-\nful authorities, it has thus far sought the Court\u2019s intervention only in this case\u2014\nbecause this TRO intrudes so deeply into the President\u2019s Article II powers.   \nThe court of appeals also overlooked respondent\u2019s own litigation conduct.  In-\nstead of awaiting the district court\u2019s judgment on his back-pay claim, as many other \nremoved officials have done before, he sought preliminary injunctive relief.  Not only \nthat, he obtained an administrative stay hours after he sued and a TRO two days \nlater.  Respondent was thus the one who created this emergency.  And respondent \ncannot credibly claim that his interest in seizing the Office from the President is suf-\nficiently urgent to justify immediate relief from the district court, but that the elected \nPresident\u2019s interest in taking that department back is insufficiently urgent to justify \nimmediate relief from this Court.  \nIf anything, it is the denial of this application that would \u201cset a problematic \n \n\n35 \nprecedent.\u201d  App., infra, 41a.  For apparently the first time ever, a federal court has \nissued an injunction preventing the President from removing an agency head and \nputting someone else in his place.  Leaving that order in place would suggest that \ndistrict courts can, without appellate review, stymie any of the President\u2019s exclusive \nArticle II powers for up to 28 days (the maximum duration of a TRO under Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure 65(b)(2)).    \nOf course, federal courts have an institutional interest in \u201cthe orderly consid-\neration of cases.\u201d  App., infra, 34a.  But the Executive Branch has institutional inter-\nests too\u2014here, an interest in the President\u2019s exercise of his exclusive power to remove \nan agency head, so that the agency in question can implement the President\u2019s (rather \nthan respondent\u2019s) policies.  The district court has frustrated those interests in an \norder that manifestly violates the Constitution and defies this Court\u2019s precedents.  \nThe order should not be allowed to remain in place for one more day\u2014much less for \n\u201ctwo weeks.\u201d  App., infra, 41a.  \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should vacate the district court\u2019s February 12, 2025 order granting \nrespondent\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order.  In addition, the Acting Solic-\nitor General respectfully requests an immediate administrative stay of the district \ncourt\u2019s order pending the Court\u2019s consideration of this application. \nRespectfully submitted. \nSARAH M.

The Office of Special Counsel is an independent federal agency led by the Special \nCounsel. Plaintiff Hampton Dellinger has held the office of Special Counsel since March 6, 2024, \nfollowing his nomination by the President and confirmation by the Senate. He is entitled to \ncontinue to serve as Special Counsel for the remainder of his five-year term and may be removed \nby the President \u201conly for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1211(b).\n2. On the night of February 7, 2025, President Trump disregarded that clear statutory \nlanguage and, in a one-sentence email, purported to terminate Special Counsel Dellinger. That \nemail made no attempt to comply with the Special Counsel\u2019s for-cause removal protection. It stated \nsimply: \u201cOn behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position as \nSpecial Counsel of the US Office of Special Counsel is terminated, effective immediately.\u201d\n3. President Trump\u2019s purported removal of Special Counsel Dellinger is unlawful. It \nhas no basis in fact and thus cannot be squared with the statutory text. And it is in direct conflict \nwith nearly a century of precedent that defines the standard for removal of independent agency \nofficials and upholds the legality of virtually identical for-cause removal protections for the heads \nof independent agencies.\n4. As the Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel, Mr. Dellinger brings this \naction against President Trump, the Director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, the \nOffice of Special Counsel, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Office of Management and \nBudget, seeking a declaratory judgment and injunction and, on an emergency basis, a temporary \nrestraining order to prevent the deprivation of his statutory entitlement to exercise the duties of his \noffice.\n2\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 1     Filed 02/10/25     Page 3 of 15\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE\n5.

In 1978, Congress first established the OSC within the Merit Systems Protection Board \n(\u201cMSPB\u201d) as part of the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 (\u201cCSRA\u201d), PL 95\u2013454 (S 2640), 92 \n3\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 1     Filed 02/10/25     Page 4 of 15\nStat. 1111 (Oct. 13, 1978). The CSRA was enacted to address widespread public concerns about \nthe federal civil service\u2014including evidence that it was vulnerable to political manipulation and \nfailed to protect whistleblowers.1 \n16. The legislation that became the CSRA was first proposed by President Carter. In a \nletter to Congress, President Carter requested that Congress create the MSPB, whose members \nwould be removable only for cause, and a Special Counsel, who would be appointed by the \nPresident and confirmed by the Senate. President Carter explained that this structure was intended \nto \u201cguarantee independent and impartial protection to employees\u201d and thereby \u201csafeguard the \nrights of Federal employees who \u2018blow the whistle\u2019 on violations of laws or regulations by other \nemployees, including their supervisors.\u201d2\n17. Over the subsequent seven months, Congress worked to reduce President Carter\u2019s \nproposal to final legislation. Throughout these deliberations, Congress emphasized the importance \nof an independent Special Counsel with sufficient authority to protect federal employees. To \nensure that independence, Congress in the CSRA provided that the Special Counsel \u201cmay be \nremoved by the President only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d Civil \nService Reform Act, P.L. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111, Ch. 12, \u00a7 1204.\n18. On October 13, 1978, President Carter signed the CSRA into law, declaring that \nthe \u201clandmark legislation\u201d would create \u201ca new system of excellence and accountability.\u201d3\n1 The Civil Service and the Statutory Law of Public Employment, 97 Harv. L. Rev. 1619, 1631\u201332 \n(1984).\n2  Federal  Civil  Service  Reform  Message  to  the  Congress  (Mar.  2,  1978), \nhttps://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/federal-civil-service-reform-message-the-congress.\n3 President Jimmy Carter Remarks on Signing the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978 into Law (Oct. \n13, 1978), https://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/documents/civil-service-reform-act-1978-statement-\nsigning-s-2640-into-law.\n4\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 1     Filed 02/10/25     Page 5 of 15\n19. In 1989, Congress again responded to concerns that whistleblowers within the \nfederal civil service were not adequately protected with the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, \nPL 101\u201312, 103 Stat 16 (Apr. 10, 1989) (codified as amended at 5 U.S.C \u00a7\u00a7 1211\u20131219). With \nthat law, Congress vested the OSC with new authorities to receive complaints from whistleblowers \nand to protect them from retaliation. The Act also removed the OSC from its place within the \nMSPB and established it as an independent agency. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(a). Congress also retained the \nCSRA\u2019s for-cause removal protections, providing that the Special Counsel could be removed by \nthe President \u201conly for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b).\n20. Upon signing the Whistleblower Protection Act, President Bush celebrated that the \nAct would \u201cenhance the authority of the Office of Special Counsel to protect whistle-blowers and \nother employees victimized by prohibited personnel practices.\u201d President Bush also specifically \napproved that the Act retained \u201ccurrent law which provides that the Special Counsel may only be \nremoved for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance.\u201d4\n21. From  its  inception,  Congress  intended  that  the  Special  Counsel  act  with \nindependence  and  impartiality  to  safeguard  the  civil  service  as  both  an  \u201combudsman\u201d  and \n\u201cwatchdog.\u201d Frazier v. Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., 672 F.2d 150, 162\u201363 (D.C. Cir. 1982).\n22. The OSC\u2019s primary mission is to protect federal employees and applicants from \nprohibited personnel practices (\u201cPPPs\u201d), especially reprisal for whistleblowing. The OSC also \nprovides a secure channel for federal employees to blow the whistle by disclosing wrongdoing. It \ncivilly enforces the Hatch Act, which puts certain restrictions on partisan political activity by \n4 George H.W.

In addition to the CSRA and the Whistleblower Protection Act, Congress conferred \nauthority  on  the  OSC  through  the  Hatch  Act  and  the  Uniformed  Services  Employment  & \nReemployment Rights Act (\u201cUSERRA\u201d), Pub. L. 103-353 (1994) (codified at 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4301\u2013\n4335).\n24. When the OSC receives a complaint alleging a PPP under the CSRA, it reviews the \nallegations, assesses the evidence, and determines whether to begin an investigation. 5 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1214. When investigation is warranted, the OSC resolves most matters by assisting settlement \nor alternative dispute resolution with the complainant-employee and the agency-employer, but the \nOSC occasionally seeks corrective action on behalf of the employee in the MSPB. See 5 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 1212, 1215. If the OSC declines to seek corrective action, the employee alleging a PPP retains \nan independent right of action to file with the MSPB without OSC involvement, subject to certain \nprocedural requirements. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1221; 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1209.5(a).  \n25. The OSC follows a similar procedure upon receipt of a complaint alleging a Hatch \nAct violation. Congress enacted the Hatch Act in 1939 to restrict political activity, including \ncoerced political activity, of federal employees. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7321. In most cases of Hatch Act \nviolations, the OSC issues a nonbinding warning letter to the employee. A warning letter typically \nends the inquiry, but in rare cases of egregious and repeated violations, the OSC seeks disciplinary \naction in the MSPB. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1215. As with PPPs, the MSPB adjudicates the matter and \ndetermines what, if any, disciplinary measures are appropriate. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1204. The MSPB can \nimpose only modest civil penalties, with a maximum monetary penalty of $1,000. 5 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7326(2). Any disciplinary order imposed by the MSPB is subject to judicial review by the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7703.\n6\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 1     Filed 02/10/25     Page 7 of 15\n26. The OSC has similar, but more limited, authority under the USERRA, which \nCongress passed in 1994 to protect service members and veterans from employment discrimination \non the basis of their military service. 38 U.S.C. \u00a7 4301(a). The OSC and the Department of Labor \nshare responsibility under USERRA, and the Department refers complaints to the OSC. As with \nthe Hatch Act and PPPs, the OSC first attempts settlement to resolve any complaints and only \noccasionally initiates an action in the MSPB. Id. \u00a7 4324(a), (c).\n27. Congress  also  tasked  the  OSC  in  the  Whistleblower  Protection  Act  with  an \noversight role to review government investigations of potential wrongdoing. When a federal \nemployee files a disclosure of wrongdoing, the OSC first determines whether there is a substantial \nlikelihood that the information discloses a violation of law. If so, the OSC asks the agency to \ninvestigate and report on the matter. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1213(c). The OSC then reviews the agency\u2019s \nreport, gives the whistleblower an opportunity to comment, provides its assessment of the report, \nand submits both the agency report and the OSC\u2019s findings to Congressional oversight committees \nand to the President. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1213(e).\n28. The Special Counsel must be nominated by the President and confirmed by the \nSenate. The Special Counsel must also be \u201can attorney who, by demonstrated ability, background, \ntraining, or experience, is especially qualified to carry out the functions of the position.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1211(b). \n29. Once confirmed, the Special Counsel serves a five-year term and, if a successor has \nnot yet been appointed, up to one additional year. \u201cThe Special Counsel may be removed by the \nPresident only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b).\n7\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 1     Filed 02/10/25     Page 8 of 15\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS\n30. On October 3, 2023, President Biden nominated Plaintiff Hampton Dellinger to be \nSpecial Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel.5 The Senate confirmed Mr. Dellinger on \nFebruary 27, 2024, and he was sworn in as Special Counsel on March 6, 2024.6 Mr. Dellinger\u2019s \nfive-year term expires in 2029.\n31. On February 7, 2025, at 7:22 PM, Special Counsel Dellinger received an email from \nSergio Gor, Assistant to the President and the Director of the White House Presidential Personnel \nOffice, which stated in its entirety: \u201cOn behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to \ninform you that your position as Special Counsel of the US Office of Special Counsel is terminated, \neffective immediately. Thank you for your service[.]\u201d Ex. A.\n32. The one-sentence email does not allege any inefficiency, neglect of duty, or \nmalfeasance in office by Special Counsel Dellinger, nor could it.7 In flagrant disregard for the clear \n5 President Biden Announces Hampton Dellinger as Nominee for Special Counsel, Office of the \nSpecial Counsel (Oct. 3, 2023), https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-\nreleases/2023/10/03/president-biden-announces-hampton-dellinger-as-nominee-for-special-\ncounsel-office-of-the-special-counsel/.\n6  Hampton  Dellinger  Sworn  In  as  Special  Counsel  of  OSC  (Mar.  6,  2024), \nhttps://osc.gov/News/Pages/Press%20Release%20Template1.aspx.\n7 Only a year into his term, Special Counsel Dellinger has served with distinction and efficiency. \nIn Fiscal Year 2024, the OSC received an unprecedented number of cases while simultaneously \nreducing its Hatch Act caseload by 39 percent compared to Fiscal Year 2020. U.S. Off. of Special \nCons., OSC\u2019s 2024 Accomplishments Include Record Breaking Results and First Ever Actions \n(Jan.  6,  2025),  https://osc.gov/News/Pages/25-15-OSC-2024-Accomplishments.aspx.  Under \nSpecial Counsel Dellinger\u2019s leadership, the OSC submitted key Hatch Act reports, secured \ncompensatory damages for Army employees, launched a new transparency and accountability \ninitiative, achieved hundreds of favorable decisions on behalf of complainants alleging PPP \nviolations, and assisted over a dozen veterans in asserting their employment rights. Id. And Special \nCounsel Dellinger\u2019s work has drawn praise from organizations and individuals across the political \nspectrum. He was lauded by nonpartisan watchdog organizations for his \u201cnuts-and-bolts reforms\u201d \nto the protections that whistleblowers receive, Tom Devine, Group Praises Federal Whistleblower \nAgency  for  Nuts  and  Bolts  Reforms,  Gov\u2019t  Accountability  Proj.  (Sept.  17,  2024), \nhttps://whistleblower.org/press/group-praises-federal-whistleblower-agency-for-nuts-and-bolts-\nreforms/, and, after Special Counsel Dellinger concluded an investigation into the U.S. Coast \n8\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 1     Filed 02/10/25     Page 9 of 15\nstatutory text, Special Counsel Dellinger was purportedly terminated without basis, justification \nor authority.\n33. The OSC\u2019s ability to protect the civil service and investigate alleged misconduct is \nneeded now more than ever. Over the preceding three weeks, an unprecedented number of federal \nemployees with civil service protections have been terminated without cause. Senior career \nofficials have been purged from the Federal Bureau of Investigations. Eighteen Inspectors General \nfrom across the federal government have been removed without the justification required by \nstatute.8 And hundreds of federal employees have been locked out of their computer systems by \nthe U.S. DOGE Service Temporary Organization.9\n34. President Trump has also attempted to remove Board Member Gwynne Wilcox \nfrom the National Labor Relations Board despite clear statutory for-cause removal protection.10\nGuard\u2019s unlawful use of non-disclosure agreements to silence whistleblowers, Senator Ted Cruz \n(R-TX) responded: \u201cThank you to Special Counsel Dellinger for your attention to this issue,\u201d \n@SenTedCruz,  X  (June  6,  2024,  12:40  PM), \nhttps://x.com/SenTedCruz/status/1798756854077808858.\n8 Grassley, Durbin Seek Presidential Explanation for IG Dismissals, Senate Judiciary Comm.

These events are ongoing, and they have caused \u201cchaos\u201d and \u201cconfusion\u201d among \ncivil servants and agency officials.11 They directly implicate the public\u2019s interest in the smooth \nfunctioning of the federal workforce, and they raise troubling questions under both the civil service \nstatutes and the Constitution. \n36. Special Counsel Dellinger\u2019s purported termination has sown confusion about his \nauthority to lead the OSC and jeopardized the agency\u2019s functioning. Congress authorized the OSC \nwith a crucial investigative and oversight role to protect the integrity of the civil service in \ncircumstances such as these. The recent spate of terminations of protected civil service employees \nunder the new presidential administration has created controversies, both about the lawfulness of \nthese actions and about potential retaliation against whistleblowers. The OSC is statutorily tasked \nwith receiving such reports, investigating them, and taking appropriate action. The President\u2019s \nunlawful attempt to remove Special Counsel Dellinger from his office directly violates the modest \nbut vital protections that Congress put in place and renders the OSC and the Special Counsel unable \nto fulfill their statutory mandate.\nCLAIMS FOR RELIEF\nCOUNT ONE\nULTRA VIRES IN VIOLATION OF STATUTORY AUTHORITY\n37. The preceding paragraphs are incorporated and realleged here.\n38. Special Counsel Dellinger has a clear entitlement to remain in his office. Once \nconfirmed by the Senate, the Special Counsel serves a five-year term. 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b). The \nSpecial Counsel may be removed from that term \u201cby the President only for inefficiency, neglect \nof duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d Id.\n11 Allan Smith, \u2018Fear\u2019 and \u2018chaos\u2019 grip federal workers as Trump rapidly remakes the government, \nNBC  News  (Jan.  30,  2025),  https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/donald-trump/fear-chaos-grip-\nfederal-workers-trump-remakes-government-rcna189746.\n10\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 1     Filed 02/10/25     Page 11 of 15\n39. The constitutionality of that protection is dictated by nearly a century of binding \nSupreme Court precedent upholding materially identical restrictions. Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. \nUnited States, 295 U.S. 602, 620 (1935); Wiener v. United States, 357 U.S. 349, 356 (1958). The \nSupreme Court has determined already that because the Special Counsel \u201cexercises only limited \njurisdiction to enforce certain rules governing Federal Government employers and employees\u201d and \n\u201cdoes not bind private parties at all,\u201d the Special Counsel\u2019s for-cause removal protection does not \nimplicate the constitutional concerns that have resulted in invalidating removal protections for \nother single-head agencies. Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau, 591 U.S. 197, 221 \n(2020)\n40. President Trump\u2019s purported termination of Special Counsel Dellinger is unlawful. \nThe President did not purport to remove Special Counsel Dellinger on the basis of \u201cinefficiency, \nneglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d In fact, the President\u2019s termination email provided no \njustification at all for Special Counsel Dellinger\u2019s termination.\n41. As a result, the President\u2019s termination of Special Counsel Dellinger is ultra vires \nand is a clear violation of the statute.\nCOUNT TWO\nADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 706(1) and 706(2)\n(Against Defendants Bessent, Gor, Gorman, Kammann, and Vought)\n42. The preceding paragraphs are incorporated and realleged here.\n43. To the extent that Defendants Bessent, Gor, Gorman, Kammann, and Vought \nexercise authority with respect to, or on behalf of, the Office of Special Counsel without regard to \nMr. Dellinger\u2019s position as Special Counsel, those actions are \u201cnot in accordance with the law,\u201d \n\u201ccontrary to a constitutional right, power, privilege, or immunity,\u201d and \u201cin excess of statutory \njurisdiction, authority, or limitations, or short of statutory right.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2). Special \nCounsel Dellinger seeks to hold unlawful and set aside such actions, pursuant to section 706 the \n11\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 1     Filed 02/10/25     Page 12 of 15\nAdministrative Procedure Act and to compel agency action unlawfully withheld or unreasonably \ndelayed.\nCOUNT THREE\nDECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACT, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201 and 2202\n44. The preceding paragraphs are incorporated and realleged here.\n45. Special Counsel Dellinger is entitled to declaratory relief on the basis of all claims \nidentified. There is a substantial and ongoing controversy between Special Counsel Dellinger and \nthe Defendants, and a declaration of rights under the Declaratory Judgment Act is both necessary \nand appropriate to establish that Mr. Dellinger is the Special Counsel of the OSC and that the \nPresident  does  not  have  authority  to  remove  him  absent  inefficiency,  neglect  of  duty,  or \nmalfeasance in office.\nCOUNT FOUR\nVIOLATION OF THE SEPARATION OF POWERS\n46. The preceding paragraphs are incorporated and realleged here. \n47. President Trump\u2019s purported removal of Special Counsel Dellinger is further \ninvalid  because  it  violates  Article  I,  section 8  and  Article  II,  sections 2  and  3  of  the  U.S. \nConstitution. The Constitution empowers Congress to set reasonable limitations on the removal of \nthe heads of independent agencies and it does not confer on the President an authority to violate \nCongress\u2019s scheme. The President\u2019s purported removal of Special Counsel Dellinger violates the \nauthorities vested in Congress by the Constitution and further violates the President\u2019s duty to \u201ctake \nCare that the Laws be faithfully executed.\u201d\nCOUNT FIVE\nWRIT OF MANDAMUS\n48. The preceding paragraphs are incorporated and realleged here.\n49. In the alternative, Special Counsel Dellinger is entitled to a writ of mandamus. The \nSpecial Counsel statute\u2019s removal restrictions impose a ministerial duty on the President and \n12\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 1     Filed 02/10/25     Page 13 of 15\nsubordinate officials not to interfere with Special Counsel Dellinger\u2019s tenure in office absent cause \nfor inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. See Swan v. Clinton, 100 F.3d 973, 977-\n78 (D.C. Cir. 1996).\n50. Special Counsel Dellinger is clearly entitled to a writ of mandamus prohibiting his \nremoval from office and, absent this Court granting one of the counts identified above, there is no \nother adequate means of redress.\nCOUNT SIX\nEQUITABLE RELIEF FOR STATUTORY AND CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATIONS\n51. The preceding paragraphs are incorporated and realleged here.\n52. Under this Court\u2019s traditional equitable jurisdiction, the plaintiff is entitled to \nequitable relief to prevent and restrain ongoing violations of both statutory and constitutional \nfederal law by the defendants. Equitable actions have \u201clong been recognized as the proper means\u201d \nto prevent public officials from acting unconstitutionally. Because such actions seek simply to halt \nor prevent a violation of federal law rather than the award of money damages, they do not ask the \nCourt to imply a new cause of action. To the contrary, the ability to sue to enjoin unlawful and \nunconstitutional actions by federal officers is the creation of courts of equity and reflects a long \nhistory of judicial review of illegal executive action, tracing back to England. Armstrong v. \nExceptional Child Ctr., Inc., 575 U.S. 320, 326-27 (2015).\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF\nSpecial Counsel Dellinger requests that the Court:\na. Declare that the President\u2019s termination of Plaintiff Hampton Dellinger was \nunlawful, and that Plaintiff Hampton Dellinger is the Special Counsel and head \nof the Office of Special Counsel;\nb. Declare that the Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel may be \nremoved by the President only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance \nin office;\n13\n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 1     Filed 02/10/25     Page 14 of 15\nc. Declare that Karen Gorman is not the Acting Special Counsel of the Office of \nSpecial Counsel, nor may any other individual serve as the Acting Special \nCounsel or the head of the Office of Special Counsel;\nd. Order that Plaintiff Hampton Dellinger may not be removed from his office as \nSpecial Counsel or in any way be treated as having been removed, denied or \nobstructed  in  accessing  any  of  the  benefits  or  resources  of  his  office,  or \notherwise be obstructed from his ability to carry out his duties;\ne. Order that Defendants Bessent, Gor, Kammann, and Vought may not place an \nActing Special Counsel in Plaintiff Hampton Dellinger\u2019s position, or otherwise \nrecognize any other person as Special Counsel or as the agency head of the \nOffice of Special Counsel;\nf. Order  Defendants  Bessent,  Gor,  Gorman,  Kammann,  and  Vought  to  pay \nPlaintiff Hampton Dellinger all wages and benefits owed to him as Special \nCounsel of the Office of Special Counsel;\ng.

See February 10, 2025 Minute Order.  This order is an \nextraordinary\u2014indeed,  unprecedented\u2014intrusion  into  the  President\u2019s  authority.    Accordingly, \nDefendants have now appealed the Court\u2019s administrative stay and are requesting an emergency stay \npending appeal from the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.  Out of an abundance \nof caution to ensure compliance with Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 8(a) (\u201cA party must \nordinarily move first in the district court for . . . a stay of the judgment or order of a district court \npending appeal.\u201d), Defendants respectfully submit this motion to stay the Court\u2019s administrative stay \npending appeal. \n\u201c[T]he factors regulating the issuance of a stay are . . . (1) whether the stay applicant has made \na strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably \ninjured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 10     Filed 02/11/25     Page 2 of 3\ninterested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.\u201d  Hilton v. Braunskill, 481 U.S. 770, \n776 (1987).  Here, these factors weigh in favor of a stay. \nFirst, this Court\u2019s order greatly intrudes on the President\u2019s lawful authority.  The Supreme \nCourt has made clear\u2014twice, and recently\u2014that Article II precludes Congress from placing limits on \nthe President\u2019s authority to remove principal officers of the United States who serve as sole heads of \nan Executive Branch agency.  Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (2021); Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. \n197 (2020).  And in the wake of Seila Law and Collins, President Biden recently removed the \nCommissioner of Social Security without cause, contrary to the statutory limitations that restricted \nremoval over that agency head except for \u201cneglect of duty or malfeasance in office.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 902(a)(3).  The only courts of appeals to have considered the question\u2014the Ninth and Eleventh \nCircuits\u2014have both concluded that the removal restrictions for the single-headed Social Security \nAdministration are unconstitutional.  Kaufmann v. Kijakazi, 32 F.4th 843, 848-849 (9th Cir. 2022); \nRodriguez v. SSA, 118 F.4th 1302, 1313-1314 (11th Cir. 2024).  In removing Plaintiff as the head of \nOSC, another Executive Branch agency with a single head, the President merely exercised the same \nauthority that President Biden did in removing the Social Security Commissioner and that the Supreme \nCourt recognized as lawful in Seila Law and Collins.  Thus, Defendants have made a \u201cstrong showing\u201d \nthat they are likely to succeed on the merits on appeal.  See Hilton, 481 U.S. at 776.   \nSecond, the balance of equities and public interest overwhelmingly favor a stay pending appeal.  \nSee Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009) (noting that these factors merge in cases involving the \ngovernment).  The Court\u2019s \u201cadministrative stay\u201d\u2014in which it restored Plaintiff to the office from \nwhich the President had removed him, enjoined any efforts to impede his \u201caccess to the resources or \nmaterials of that office,\u201d and barred the installation of \u201cany other person as Special Counsel\u201d\u2014is an \nextraordinary act.  It is an unprecedented intrusion into the President\u2019s authority to exercise \u201call of\u201d \n\u201cthe \u2018executive Power\u2019\u201d of the United States, Seila Law, 590 U.S. at 203, as Defendants are unaware of \nany other occasion in American history where a federal court has purported to reinstall a principal \nofficer of the United States after the President has removed him.  As a result of the Court\u2019s order, a \nperson the President has chosen to remove from office is exercising executive power over the \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 10     Filed 02/11/25     Page 3 of 3\nPresident\u2019s objection.  That sort of harm to the Executive, and to the constitutional separation of \npowers, is transparently irreparable. \nConversely, Plaintiff has not established that he will suffer irreparable harm if the Court\u2019s \norder is stayed pending appeal.  A stay is not necessary to prevent any cognizable harm to Plaintiff.  \nSee English v. Trump, 279 F. Supp. 3d 307, 336 (D.D.C. 2018) (no irreparable harm to plaintiff who \nalleged that she had wrongfully been prevented from serving as Acting CFPB Director).  And to the \nextent Plaintiff asserts irreparable harm to the functioning of OSC itself, that assertion is misplaced, \nboth because OSC can continue to function with an Acting Special Counsel (who had already assumed \nPlaintiff\u2019s role before the district court\u2019s order) and because Plaintiff would lack standing to raise such \na harm. \nFor these reasons, the Court should grant a stay of its administrative stay pending resolution \nof Defendants\u2019 appeal. \n \n \nDated: February 11, 2025        Respectfully submitted, \n               \n              BRETT A.

The Supreme \nCourt has recently made clear in two separate cases that Article II precludes Congress from placing \nlimits on the President\u2019s authority to remove principal officers of the United States who serve as sole \nheads of an Executive Branch agency.  Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (2021); Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, \n591  U.S.  197  (2020).    Consistent  with  those  cases,  in  2021,  President  Biden  removed  the \nCommissioner of Social Security, and the only courts of appeals to have addressed the constitutionality \nof that removal have sustained it.  Rodriguez v. SSA, 118 F.4th 1302, 1313-14 (11th Cir. 2024); Kaufmann \nv. Kijakazi, 32 F.4th 843, 848-49 (9th Cir. 2022).  The President lawfully exercised that same authority \nwhen he removed Plaintiff from his post last week. \nNonetheless, on February 10, 2025, Plaintiff filed this lawsuit challenging his removal.  Compl., \nECF No. 1.  That day, he also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order, requesting that the \nCourt reinstate him to his former position and enjoin Defendants from recognizing \u201cany other \nperson\u201d as the head of OSC.  See Pl.\u2019s Mot. for Temporary Restraining Order at 1-2, ECF No. 2.  Such \nan order would be an unprecedented intrusion into the well-established authority of the Executive.  \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 11     Filed 02/11/25     Page 2 of 15\nFor the following reasons, the Court should deny this extraordinary request. \nFirst, Plaintiff has not demonstrated that he is likely to succeed on the merits.  As noted, \nbinding Supreme Court precedent holds that removal restrictions imposed on single-agency heads \nviolate the President\u2019s Article II power to supervise those who wield executive power on his behalf.  \nIn Seila Law, the Court invalidated the statutory restrictions on removal of the Director of the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and in Collins, the Court explained that Seila Law was \n\u201call but dispositive\u201d as to the invalidity of similar restrictions on the removal of the Director of the \nFederal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA), explaining that \u201c[t]he FHFA (like the CFPB) is an agency \nled by a single Director.\u201d  594 U.S. at 250-51.  Plaintiff offers no compelling reason why these holdings \nwould not equally apply to the head of the OSC, the only single-head agency whose removal \nrestrictions have not yet been addressed by a federal court. \nSecond, Plaintiff has not demonstrated that in the absence of a temporary restraining order, he \nwill suffer imminent irreparable harm.  The loss of government employment constitutes irreparable \nharm only in a \u201cgenuinely extraordinary situation,\u201d Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 92 & n.68 (1974), \nand Plaintiff does not even attempt to argue that he meets this high bar.  Rather, he casts his claim of \nirreparable harm as a deprivation of a \u201cstatutory right to function\u201d as the head of OSC, see Pl.\u2019s Mem. \nof Law in Support of Pl.\u2019s Mot. for a Temporary Restraining Order (\u201cPl.\u2019s Mot.\u201d) at 15, ECF No. 2-\n1. But in English v. Trump, another district court in this Circuit rejected the identical argument in \nanalogous circumstances.  279 F. Supp. 3d 307, 333 (D.D.C. 2018) (holding that loss of status as \nActing CFPB director did not constitute irreparable harm to plaintiff).  And if Plaintiff asserts \nirreparable harm to the functioning of OSC itself, that assertion is misplaced, both because OSC can \ncontinue to function with an Acting Special Counsel (who had already assumed Plaintiff\u2019s role before \nthis Court\u2019s administrative stay) and because Plaintiff would lack standing to raise such a harm. \nThird, the balance of the equities and public interest favor Defendants.  The relief that Plaintiffs \nseek\u2014an order requiring the President to reinstate a person who he has chosen to remove from \noffice\u2014is unprecedented.  And with good reason:  such an order would greatly impede President\u2019s \nauthority to exercise \u201call of\u201d \u201cthe \u2018executive Power\u2019\u201d of the United States.  Seila Law, 590 U.S. at 203.  \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 11     Filed 02/11/25     Page 3 of 15\nAllowing Plaintiff to exercise executive power over the President\u2019s objection unquestionably inflicts \nirreparable harm on both the Executive and the separation of powers. \nBecause the merits and the other temporary restraining order factors all cut against Plaintiff, \nhis motion for extraordinary preliminary relief should be denied.  \nBACKGROUND \nI.  Statutory Background \nCongress created the Office of the Special Counsel as part of the Civil Service Reform Act of \n1978.  Pub. L. No. 95-454, \u00a7 202(a), 92 Stat. 1111, 1122.  The Act authorized the Special Counsel to \nreceive and investigate \u201cany allegation of a prohibited personnel practice,\u201d 92 Stat. at 1125, and to \nrequest corrective action from the Merit Systems Protection Board in cases where agency heads \ndeclined to correct impermissible practices, id. at 1127, among other powers.  The Act provided that \nthe Special Counsel could \u201cbe removed by the President only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or \nmalfeasance in office.\u201d  Id. \nFrom the beginning, the Executive Branch objected to the constitutionality of that removal \nrestriction.  In a published opinion, the Carter Administration\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel explained \nthat \u201c[b]ecause the Special Counsel [would] be performing largely executive functions, the Congress \n[could] not restrict the President\u2019s power to remove him.\u201d  Memorandum Opinion for the General Counsel, \nCivil Service Commission, 2 Op. OLC 120, 122 (1978); see Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 221 (noting this \n\u201ccontemporaneous constitutional objection\u201d).  And when Congress passed an initial version of the \nWhistleblower Protection Act in 1988, separating OSC from the Merit Systems Protection Board and \nvesting OSC with additional powers, President Reagan pocket-vetoed the legislation, explaining that \nit \u201craised serious constitutional concerns\u201d by, among other things, \u201cpurport[ing] to insulate the Office \nfrom presidential supervision and to limit the power of the President to remove his subordinates from \noffice.\u201d  Public Papers of the Presidents, Ronald Reagan, Vol. II, Oct. 26, 1988, pp. 1391-1392 (1991); \nsee Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 221 (citing this \u201cveto on constitutional grounds\u201d). \nCongress ultimately passed a revised version of the Whistleblower Protection Act that \nseparated OSC from the Merit Systems Protection Board while removing certain of the additional \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 11     Filed 02/11/25     Page 4 of 15\npowers that the initial version would have granted the Office.  Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, \nPub. L. No. 101-12, 103 Stat. 16.  President George H.W. Bush signed that bill, notwithstanding its \nmaintenance of the restrictions on removal of the Special Counsel.  But the Executive Branch did not \nrecede from its constitutional objection to Congress\u2019s placement of restrictions on the removal of \nagency heads.  In 1994, for example, the Office of Legal Counsel advised President Clinton \u201cthat the \n[Social Security Administration]\u2019s new structure as an agency led by a single person with tenure \nprotection was \u2018extraordinary\u2019\u201d and that the tenure protection presented a \u201c\u2018serious constitutional \nquestion\u2019\u201d  because  it  \u201c\u2018would  severely  erode  the  President\u2019s  authority.\u2019\u201d    Constitutionality  of  the \nCommissioner of Social Security\u2019s Tenure Protection, 45 Op. O.L.C. __, 2021 WL 2981542, at *2 (O.L.C. July \n8, 2021) (quoting Letter for Lloyd N. Cutler, Counsel to the President, from Walter Dellinger, \nAssistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel (July 29, 1994)). \nToday, OSC exercises both the same powers as it originally possessed and more.  The Special \nCounsel is vested with an array of executive powers and functions, including a broad range of \ninvestigatory and disciplinary powers.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1212.  For example, the Act provides that the \nSpecial Counsel \u201cshall receive any allegation of a prohibited personnel practice and shall investigate \nthe allegation to the extent necessary to determine whether there are reasonable grounds to believe \nthat a prohibited personnel practice has occurred, exists, or is to be taken,\u201d id. \u00a7 1214(a)(1)(A), but it \nalso permits the Special Counsel to conduct such an investigation \u201cin the absence of an allegation,\u201d \nid. \u00a7 1214(a)(5).  The Special Counsel has the authority to \u201cexamine witnesses, take depositions, and \nreceive evidence,\u201d as well as to \u201cissue subpoenas\u201d and \u201corder the taking of depositions and order \nresponses to written interrogatories.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1212(b)(1)-(2).  The Special Counsel can also \u201cbring \npetitions  for  stays,  and  petitions  for  corrective  action,\u201d  and  \u201cfile  a  complaint  or  make \nrecommendations for disciplinary action\u201d to the Merit Systems Protection Board.  Id. \u00a7 1212(a)(2)(A)-\n(B).  That can result in \u201cremoval, reduction in grade, debarment from Federal employment for a period \nnot to exceed 5 years, suspension, or reprimand.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1215(3)(a).  And in 2017, Congress enhanced \nOSC\u2019s investigatory powers, including by barring any assertions of common law privileges that would \n\u201cprevent the Special Counsel from obtaining any material\u201d within its purview. See id. \u00a7 1212(a)(5)(C)(i); \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 11     Filed 02/11/25     Page 5 of 15\nPub. L. No. 115-91, \u00a71097(a), 131 Stat. 1615 (2017). \nII.  The Present Controversy \nPlaintiff was appointed to serve as Special Counsel by President Biden in October 2023, and \nconfirmed by the Senate in February 2024. Compl. \u00b6 30.  He was sworn in on March 6, 2024.  Id. \u00b6 1.  \nOn February 7, 2025, the Director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office informed \nPlaintiff that he was being removed from his position as Special Counsel, effective immediately.  Id. \n\u00b6 2.  On February 10, 2025, Plaintiff filed this lawsuit.  See generally Compl.  Later that day, he also filed \na motion for a temporary restraining order, requesting that he be reinstated as Special Counsel.  See \nECF No. 2.  Upon receiving the motion, the Court set a near-immediate hearing, before the \ngovernment had responded to the motion for a temporary restraining order.   \nSeveral hours later, the Court entered what it described as \u201ca brief administrative stay,\u201d \nreasoning that the stay was necessary \u201cto preserve the status quo.\u201d  The Court\u2019s order temporarily \nrestored Plaintiff to the office of Special Counsel and enjoined defendants from \u201cdeny[ing] him access \nto the resources or materials of that office or recogniz[ing] the authority of any other person as Special \nCounsel.\u201d  Feb. 10, 2025 Minute Order.  Defendants have since appealed that order and are seeking \nemergency relief in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit.  ECF No. 7. \nLEGAL STANDARD \nPlaintiff seeks a temporary restraining order\u2014\u201can extraordinary remedy never awarded as of \nright.\u201d Winter v. NRDC, 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008).  To obtain such extraordinary relief, a plaintiff \u201cmust \nshow (1) \u2018he is likely to succeed on the merits,\u2019 (2) \u2018he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence \nof preliminary relief,\u2019 (3) \u2018the balance of equities tips in his favor,\u2019 and (4) issuing \u2018an injunction is in \nthe public interest.\u2019\u201d  Hanson v. District of Columbia, 120 F.4th 223, 231 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (quoting Winter, \n555 U.S. at 20); see also Chef Time 1520 LLC v. Small Bus. Admin., 646 F.

Vilsack, 808 \nF.3d 905, 913 (D.C. Cir. 2015).  Plaintiff also must establish irreparable harm, as failure do so is \n\u201cgrounds for refusing to issue [preliminary relief], even if the other three factors entering the calculus \nmerit such relief.\u201d Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006); accord \nWright & Miller, 11A Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. \u00a7 2948.1 (3d ed.)

USCIS, No. CV 20-00920 (BAH), 2020 WL 5061735, at *3 (D.D.C. \nAug. 27, 2020) (citations omitted); see also Mylan Pharms., Inc. v. Shalala, 81 F.

(cleaned up). \nARGUMENT \nPlaintiff fails to satisfy any of the factors necessary for the extraordinary remedy he seeks\u2014a \nmandatory temporary restraining order compelling Defendants, including the President, to reinstate \nhim to a position from which he has been removed.  Such an order would be unprecedented and \nunwarranted. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 11     Filed 02/11/25     Page 7 of 15\nI.  Plaintiff Cannot Succeed On The Merits \nOSC is an Executive Branch agency \u201cheaded by a single officer,\u201d Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 221.  \nAs described above, from the time OSC was first created in 1978, and across several administrations \nin the years since, the Executive Branch has expressed doubt as to whether Congress may preclude \nthe President from removing the Special Counsel at will.  Over the past five years, Supreme Court \nprecedent  has  definitively  resolved  that  question  in  the  negative.    Officials  vested  with  sole \nresponsibility for overseeing the exercise of executive power must be directly answerable to the \nPresident. \nA.  At will removal is the general rule, and OSC does not fit within any exceptions.  \nArticle II of the Constitution provides that \u201cthe \u2018executive Power\u2019\u2014all of it\u2014is \u2018vested in a \nPresident,\u2019 who must \u2018take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\u2019\u201d  Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 \nU.S. 197, 203 (2020) (quoting U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 1, cl. 1; id. \u00a7 3).  To discharge those responsibilities, \nthe President \u201cas a general matter\u201d has \u201cauthority to remove those who assist him in carrying out his \nduties.\u201d  Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Accounting Oversight Board, 561 U.S. 477, 513-14 (2010).  \u201cWithout \nsuch power, the President could not be held fully accountable for discharging his own responsibilities; \nthe buck would stop somewhere else.\u201d  Id. at 514. \nThe Supreme Court has \u201crecognized only two exceptions to the President\u2019s unrestricted \nremoval power.\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 203.  First, in Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 \n(1935), the Court held that Congress could \u201cgive for-cause removal protections to a multimember \nbody of experts, balanced along partisan lines, that performed legislative and judicial functions and \nwas said not to exercise any executive power.\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 216.  Second, the Court has held \nthat \u201cCongress could provide tenure protections to certain inferior officers with narrowly defined \nduties.\u201d  Id. at 204. \nThe Special Counsel does not fit within either of these exceptions.  He is not an inferior officer \nwith narrowly defined duties\u2014he is a principal officer appointed by the President with Senate \nconfirmation, see U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2; 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b), who oversees his own Department \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 11     Filed 02/11/25     Page 8 of 15\nand is not subservient to any other principal officer, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1211-1212.  See also Free Enterprise \nFund, 561 U.S. at 511 (explaining that a Department \u201cis a freestanding component of the Executive \nBranch, not subordinate to or contained within any other such component\u201d).  Nor does the Special \nCounsel work as part of a \u201cmultimember expert agency,\u201d Seila Law LLC, 591 U.S. at 218; he instead \nserves as the sole head of his agency, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(a). \nB.  Heads of single-member Executive departments must be removable at will by \nthe President.  \nFive years ago, the Supreme Court surveyed the Executive Branch and identified only four \nthen-existing examples of single-member agencies whose heads were afforded protection against at-\nwill removal.  See Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 290-92.  As described below, the Supreme Court has now itself \ninvalidated the removal protections for two of these agencies (the CFPB and the FHFA).  The Office \nof Legal Counsel and two courts of appeals have concluded that the removal protections for a third \n(the Social Security Administration) are likewise invalid.  The Office of Special Counsel is the fourth. \nIn Seila Law, the Supreme Court invalidated the removal restrictions for the Director of the \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau, explaining that the \u201csingle-Director structure contravenes\u201d \nthe Constitution\u2019s \u201ccarefully calibrated system by vesting significant governmental power in the hands \nof a single individual accountable to no one.\u201d  591 U.S. at 224.  When the Founders chose to vest \nexecutive authority in a single person, they ensured that the President would be \u201cthe most democratic \nand politically accountable official in Government . . . elected by the entire Nation.\u201d  Id.  Thus, while \nexecutive officers obviously assist the President in carrying out his responsibilities, they \u201cremain[] \nsubject to the ongoing supervision and control of the elected President.\u201d  Id.  By contrast, the CFPB \nDirector  could  \u201cunilaterally,  without  meaningful  supervision,  issue  final  regulations,  oversee \nadjudications, set enforcement priorities, initiate prosecutions, and determine what penalties to \nimpose,\u201d id. at 225, while the President was constrained to permit the Director to do so absent \n\u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d  12 U.S.C. \u00a7 5491(c)(3).  The Court held that \nrestriction unconstitutional, holding that \u201cprincipal officers who, acting alone, wield significant \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 11     Filed 02/11/25     Page 9 of 15\nexecutive power\u201d must be removable at will by the President.  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 238.1 \nThe Supreme Court applied the same logic when it invalidated the \u201cfor cause\u201d removal \nrestriction for the Director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency.  Collins, 594 U.S. at 226-28.  The \nCourt explained that Seila Law was \u201call but dispositive,\u201d as the FHFA was \u201can agency led by a single \nDirector\u201d for whom Congress had \u201crestrict[ed] the President\u2019s removal power.\u201d  Id. at 250-51.  In \ndoing so, the Court rejected an argument that the FHFA should be treated differently because it did \nnot exercise as much executive authority as the CFPB did.  Id. at 251.  \u201c[T]he nature and breadth of \nan agency\u2019s authority is not dispositive in determining whether Congress may limit the President\u2019s \npower to remove its head.\u201d  Id. at 251-52.  The key purpose of the removal power is to ensure that \n\u201cExecutive Branch actions\u201d are subject \u201cto a degree of electoral accountability,\u201d which is \u201cimplicated \nwhenever an agency does important work.\u201d  Id. at 252.  Collins thus declined to carve out an exception \nto the general rule of at-will removal based on \u201cthe relative importance of the regulatory and \nenforcement authority of disparate agencies.\u201d  Id. at 253. \nConsistent with those holdings, President Biden removed the Commissioner of Social Security \nwithout cause, contrary to the statutory limitations that restricted removal over that agency head \nexcept for \u201cneglect of duty or malfeasance in office.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(a)(3); see L.M. v. Commissioner, \n2021 WL 8268034, at *1 (M.D. Ga. Dec. 3, 2021).  In supporting the legality of that decision, the \nDepartment of Justice explained that \u201cthe best reading of Collins and Seila Law\u201d led to the conclusion \nthat \u201cthe President need not heed the Commissioner\u2019s statutory tenure protection.\u201d  Constitutionality of \nthe Commissioner of Social Security's Tenure Protection, 45 Op. O.L.C. ---, 2021 WL 2981542, at *1, 7 (O.L.C. \n \n1 Plaintiff attempts to distinguish this case by selectively quoting from the Supreme Court\u2019s statement \nin Seila Law that OSC does not \u201cwield regulatory authority comparable to the CFPB.\u201d  See Pl.\u2019s Mot. \nat 11-12 (citing Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 221).  In fact, the Supreme Court cast doubt on the viability of \nthe Special Counsel\u2019s removal protections, noting that OSC was \u201ccreated nearly 200 years after the \nConstitution was ratified\u201d and \u201cdrew a contemporaneous constitutional objection from the Office of \nLegal Counsel under President Carter and a subsequent veto on constitutional grounds by President \nReagan.\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 221.  The Court then characterized the SSA and FHFA in similar \nterms, id. at 221-22, and as explained, the removal protections for the heads of those agencies have \nsince been held unconstitutional. \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 11     Filed 02/11/25     Page 10 of 15\nJuly 8, 2021).  Perhaps unsurprisingly, the only courts of appeal to have considered the question\u2014the \nNinth and Eleventh Circuits\u2014have both concluded that the removal restrictions for the single-headed \nSocial Security Administration are unconstitutional.  Rodriguez v. SSA, 118 F.4th 1302, 1313-14 (11th \nCir. 2024); Kaufmann v. Kijakazi, 32 F.4th 843, 848-49 (9th Cir. 2022). \nThere is no doubt that the Special Counsel exercises executive authority:  He may \u201cinvestigate \nallegations of prohibited personnel practices,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1212(a)(2); \u201cbring actions concerning \nallegations of violations of other laws within the jurisdiction of\u201d his office, id. \u00a7 1212(a)(4); issue \nsubpoenas, id. \u00a7 1212(b)(2)(A); intervene in other proceedings before the Merit Systems Protection \nBoard, id. \u00a7 1212(c)(1); appoint others, id. \u00a7 1212(d)(1); prescribe regulations, id. \u00a7 1212(e); appear in \nfederal court as an amicus curiae, id. \u00a7 1212(h)(1); and bring disciplinary actions against federal \nemployees, id. \u00a7 1215(a)(1).  These are core executive functions.2  See, e.g., Rieth-Riley Constr. Co. v. \nNLRB, 114 F.4th 519, 531 (6th Cir. 2024) (recognizing in the context of the NLRB General Counsel \nthat \u201c[t]he authority to initiate or dismiss complaints is a purely executive, not judicial, function\u201d and \n\u201cis squarely on the prosecutorial side of the \u2018prosecutorial versus adjudicatory line\u2019\u201d).  Indeed, Plaintiff \nhimself, represented at the time by the Department of Justice, has argued that the Special Counsel \nengages in core executive functions like investigation and prosecution.  Final Appellee Br., America \nFirst Legal Foundation v. Dellinger, No. 24-5168 (D.C. Cir.), at 15-16. \nNotwithstanding Plaintiff\u2019s attempt to minimize the significant executive authority wielded by \nOSC, see Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 12-13, its exercise of that authority clearly implicates the faithful execution of \n \n2 Plaintiff strains to describe OSC as \u201cquasi-legislative,\u201d Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 13, but only references OSC\u2019s \nability to enforce compliance \u201cwith congressionally imposed ethical and personnel requirements\u201d and \nthe requirement that OSC transmit to Congress upon request \u201cthe Special Counsel\u2019s views on \nfunctions, responsibilities, or other matters relating to the Office\u201d and a report when \u201can allegation \nsubmitted to the Special Counsel is resolved by an agreement between an agency and an individual,\u201d \n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1217.  These are plainly not quasi-legislative functions, which the Supreme Court has \n\u201c[b]ack[ed] away from\u201d relying on in any event.  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 217.  Indeed, OSC\u2019s authority \nto enforce federal statutes only underscores that its power is akin to that of a federal prosecutor, who \nexercises a core executive function. \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 11     Filed 02/11/25     Page 11 of 15\nfederal law.3  As the Carter Administration explained in 1978, \u201cthe Special Counsel\u2019s functions are \nexecutive in character\u201d and his \u201crole in investigating and prosecuting prohibited practices is much the \nsame as that of a U.S. Attorney or other Federal prosecutors,\u201d which \u201care directed at the enforcement \nof the laws.\u201d  Memorandum Opinion for the General Counsel, Civil Service Commission, 2 Op. OLC at 120.  \nFor these reasons, the Carter Administration objected to the Office of Special Counsel when it was \nfirst created, explaining that \u201cCongress may not properly limit the grounds for removal of the Special \nCounsel by the President,\u201d because the Special Counsel \u201cmust be removable at will.\u201d  Id.  Even at that \ntime, before Seila Law and Collins, it was clear that Humphrey\u2019s Executor did \u201cnot extend to an officer \nappointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, who performs predominantly \nexecutive functions and who, by reason of the statutory scheme, is independent of the quasi-judicial \nprocess.\u201d  Id. at 122.  And President Reagan reiterated those \u201cserious constitutional concerns\u201d about \nthe Special Counsel\u2019s insulation from electoral accountability.  See Public Papers of the Presidents, \nRonald Reagan, Vol. II, Oct. 26, 1988, pp. 1391-1392 (1991).  Since that time, these serious \nconstitutional concerns have only been heightened, as evidenced by the Supreme Court\u2019s recent \npronouncements that similar restrictions are unconstitutional. \nC.  Plaintiff cannot show entitlement to reinstatement.  \nIf that were not enough, Plaintiff is deeply mistaken in seeking judicial reinstatement to a \nprincipal office.  When principal officers have been removed from their posts, they have challenged \nthat removal in suits for back pay.  See Humphrey\u2019s Executor, 295 U.S. at 612 (challenge sought \u201cto \nrecover a sum of money alleged to be due\u201d); Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 106 (1926) (same); \nWiener v. United States, 357 U.S. 349, 349-351 (1958) (same).  The President cannot be compelled to \nretain the services of a principal officer who the President no longer believes should be entrusted with \nthe  exercise  of  executive  power.    Such a  remedy  would  undermine  the  objective  of electoral \n \n3 To the extent Plaintiff claims that OSC exercises a more \u201climited\u201d set of executive functions, Pl.\u2019s \nMot. at 12, the Supreme Court expressly rejected this argument in Collins, explaining that \u201cthe nature \nand breadth of an agency\u2019s authority is not dispositive in determining whether Congress may limit the \nPresident\u2019s power to remove its head.\u201d  594 U.S. at 251-52. \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 11     Filed 02/11/25     Page 12 of 15\naccountability within the Executive Branch that animated the holdings in Seila Law and Collins. \n \nII.  Plaintiff Fails To Identify Any Irreparable Harm \nThe \u201chigh standard for irreparable injury\u201d\u2014even higher here insofar as Plaintiff requests a \nmandatory injunction that would alter the status quo, Phillip v. Fairfield Univ., 118 F.3d 131, 133 (2d \nCir. 1997)\u2014requires a two-fold showing by Plaintiff:  First, because an irreparable injury \u201cmust be \nboth certain and great,\u201d Plaintiff \u201cmust show \u2018the injury complained of is of such imminence that there \nis a \u201cclear and present\u201d need for equitable relief to prevent irreparable harm.\u2019\u201d Chaplaincy of Full Gospel \nChurches, 454 F.3d at 297 (quoting Wisc. Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985)).  And \nsecond, \u201cthe injury must be beyond remediation.\u201d  Id. \nPlaintiff has failed to meet his burden for either of the two required showings.  He principally \ncontends that his ongoing harm stems from his inability \u201cto serve as the lawful agency head of the \nOSC.\u201d  Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 14-15.  But only in a \u201cgenuinely extraordinary situation\u201d may loss of employment \nconstitute irreparable harm.  Sampson, 415 U.S. at 92 & n.68.  And this is not such a situation.  See id. \nat 89-92 (holding loss of income, face, and reputation do not amount to irreparable harm).  Indeed, \ncourt after court in this Circuit and others have concluded that loss of employment does not constitute \nirreparable harm.  See, e.g., Hetreed v. Allstate Ins. Co., 135 F.3d 1155, 1158 (7th Cir. 1998); Davis v. \nBillington, 76 F. Supp. 3d 59, 65-66 (D.D.C. 2014) (collecting cases); Farris v. Rice, 453 F. Supp. 2d 76, \n79-80 (D.D.C. 2006) (\u201ccases are legion holding that loss of employment does not constitute irreparable \ninjury\u201d).  And to the extent that Plaintiff attempts to distinguish his former position from a \u201cgarden-\nvariety employment dispute,\u201d Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 16, courts have repeatedly rejected the notion that the \ndeprivation of a unique, singular, or high-level position is any more of an irreparable injury.  See Hetreed, \n135 F.3d at 1158 (loss of position as senior manager leading audit department not irreparable injury); \nMarxe v. Jackson, 833 F.2d 1121, 1122 (3d Cir. 1987) (division manager); Rubino v. City of Mount Vernon, \n707 F.2d 53 (2d Cir. 1983) (mayoral-appointed City Assessor); Franks v. Nimmo, 683 F.2d 1290, 1291 \n(10th Cir. 1982) (Associate Chief of Staff for Research and Development position at Department of \nVeterans Affairs Medical Center); EEOC v. City of Janesville, 630 F.2d 1254, 1256 (7th Cir. 1980) (Chief \nof Police); Levesque v. Maine, 587 F.2d 78, 79 (1st Cir. 1978) (Maine Commissioner of Manpower); \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 11     Filed 02/11/25     Page 13 of 15\nNichols v. Agency for Int\u2019l Dev., 18 F. Supp. 2d 1, 2, 4 (D.D.C. 1998) (Chief of Information Management \nSystems, Office of Inspector General); Burns v. GAO Emps. Fed. Credit Union, No. 88-3424, 1988 WL \n134925, at *1\u20132 (D.D.C. Dec. 2, 1988) (President of Credit Union Board of Directors). \nPlaintiff also argues that his purported deprivation of his \u201cstatutory right to function\u201d as the \nhead of OSC constitutes irreparable harm.  Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 15.  But the district court in English v. Trump \nrejected an identical argument, holding that the plaintiff could not show that deprivation of her \npurported status as Acting Director of the CFPB constituted irreparable harm.  279 F. Supp. 3d at \n333-36.  Plaintiff omits any citation to English (despite his counsel having appeared as counsel of record \nin that case), instead relying solely on two cases that are plainly distinguishable and that were both \nlater vacated by the D.C. Circuit: Berry v. Reagan, No. 83-3182, 1983 WL 538, at *5 (D.D.C. Nov. 14, \n1983), vacated, 732 F.2d 949 (D.C. Cir. 1983), and Mackie v. Bush, 809 F. Supp. 144, 146 (D.D.C.), vacated \nsub nom. Mackie v. Clinton, 10 F.3d 13 (D.C. Cir. 1993). \nIndeed, English held that the district court\u2019s vacated analysis in Berry v. Reagan did not control \nfor reasons that apply here with equal force.  In Berry, President Reagan removed several members of \nthe Commission on Civil Rights, an action that dissolved the Commission and meant that it could not \ncomplete a report it was statutorily required to complete by a date certain.  Id. at *1, *5.  But like in \nEnglish, Plaintiff and OSC \u201care not similarly situated\u201d to the plaintiffs in Berry, as OSC \u201ccontinues to \noperate\u201d with Ms. Gorman \u201cfunctioning as acting\u201d Special Counsel.  English, 279 F. Supp. 3d at 335.  \nAnd like in English, \u201cany such harm\u201d to Plaintiff coming solely from him not functioning as the Special \nCounsel \u201ccan be remediated in the ordinary course of this case.\u201d  Id.  That stands in contrast to Berry, \nin which \u201cany harm suffered by the commissioners was plainly irreparable because the commission \nwould have expired and they could not have been reinstated to it.\u201d  Id. \nSimilarly, in Mackie v. Bush, the President sought to remove the majority of the Board of \nGovernors of the Postal Service Board, an action that would \u201cbe irrevocably disruptive of the Board\u2019s \nfunction.\u201d 809 F. Supp. at 146.  As noted, OSC is perfectly capable of functioning without Plaintiff, \njust as it did before he became Special Counsel less than one year ago.  Moreover, in Mackie, the district \ncourt  entered  an  injunction  preventing  the  removal  of  the  governors before  their  removal  was \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 11     Filed 02/11/25     Page 14 of 15\neffectuated, id. at 148\u2014it did not reinstate an officer who had already been removed, as Plaintiff \nrequests this Court do here. \nPlaintiff\u2019s remaining claims of irreparable harm are similarly unavailing.  Plaintiff first claims \nthat a temporary restraining order is warranted because another person could be nominated and \nconfirmed such that his claim would be moot.  Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 15.  This argument is specious\u2014as Plaintiff \nwell knows, Plaintiff\u2019s own nomination occurred 147 days before he was confirmed, Compl. at 8, and \na temporary restraining order lasts at most 28 days, Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 65(b)(2). \nPlaintiff next argues that denying him preliminary relief would deprive OSC of the \u201cability to \nfulfill\u201d its \u201cmandate.\u201d  Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 15 (citing Berry, 1983 WL 538, at *5).  But as explained, unlike in \nBerry, OSC can continue to fulfill its mandate without Plaintiff, since the Acting Special Counsel has \nstepped into his role.  In any event, Plaintiff would have no standing to claim he is suffering this \npurported harm, since he is neither a whistleblower nor a party subject to OSC\u2019s authority.  See Allen \nv. Wright, 468 U.S. 737, 758 (1984).  Even assuming any injury attributable to a lack of ability for OSC \nto fulfill its mandate (which there is not), that is not an injury to Plaintiff, but one to the interests of \nthe public and of the United States.  And those interests have to be informed and defined by the \nExecutive, who has determined that Plaintiff\u2019s service as the Special Counsel is no longer in the best \ninterests of the public. \nFinally, Plaintiff asserts\u2014without any supporting evidence\u2014that Plaintiff\u2019s removal \u201cmay \nresult in individuals who lack lawful authorization\u201d accessing OSC information.  Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 15-16.  \nThis argument is entirely speculative and lacks any basis in the record of this case.  And again, \nPlaintiff\u2019s alleged injury stems from the removal of his job duties, not from any hypothetical injury \nconcerning the information of others.  See Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 493 (1975).  He may not obtain \na temporary restraining order based on irreparable harm to some other, unidentified individuals. \nIII.  The Balance Of Equities And Public Interest Favor Defendants \nGranting the extraordinary relief requested would be an unprecedented intrusion into the \nPresident\u2019s authority to exercise \u201call of\u201d \u201cthe \u2018executive Power\u2019\u201d of the United States.  Seila Law, 590 \nU.S. at 203.  Defendants are unaware of any historical precedent where a federal court reinstalled a \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 11     Filed 02/11/25     Page 15 of 15\nsingle agency head of the United States after the President has removed him.  That sort of harm to \nthe Executive, and to the constitutional separation of powers, is transparently irreparable. \nMoreover, the public interest is better served by a Special Counsel who holds the President\u2019s \nconfidence, and thus will more effectively serve him in executing his duties as Commander-in-Chief.  \nAnd \u201cthe Government has traditionally been granted the widest latitude in the \u2018dispatch of its own \ninternal affairs.\u2019\u201d  Sampson, 415 U.S. at 83 (quoting Cafeteria and Restaurant Workers Union, Local 473, \nA.F.L.-C.I.O. v. McElroy, 367 U.S. 886, 896 (1961)).  The public interest is best served by maintaining \nthis traditional deference to the government\u2019s internal management of its own personnel. \nCONCLUSION \n  For the reasons above, the Court should deny Plaintiff\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining \norder. \n \n \n \nDated: February 11, 2025        Respectfully submitted, \n               \n              BRETT A.

See ECF 10. This Court should deny that motion \nto stay, for three reasons. First, the Court of Appeals lacks jurisdiction to consider the Defendants\u2019 \nappeal. Second, the Defendants\u2019 litigation conduct militates against affording them discretionary, \nequitable relief. Finally, and in all events, the arguments advanced by Defendants lack merit.  \nI.  The Defendants\u2019 Appeal is Jurisdictionally Improper   \nThe Defendants\u2019 request \u201cto stay the Court\u2019s administrative stay pending appeal\u201d fails at \nthe outset because there is no jurisdictional basis for the D.C. Circuit to review this Court\u2019s order. \nMot. at 1. The absence of appellate jurisdiction defeats any basis to stay proceedings here.  \nIt is black-letter law that the grant of a temporary restraining order is presumptively not \nappealable. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1); e.g., Hope v. Warden York Cnty. Prison, 956 F.3d 156, \n159 (3d Cir. 2020); Native Vill. of Chenaga Bay v. Lujan, No. 91-5042, 1991 WL 40471, at *1 \n(D.C. Cir. Mar. 8, 1991) (per curiam); Adams v. Vance, 570 F.2d 950, 953 (D.C. Cir. 1977) (per \ncuriam). The principal exception to that rule\u2014which the Defendants do not even cite here, but do \ncite in their filing this morning with the D.C. Circuit\u2014is narrowly limited to cases in which a TRO \neffectively operates as a preliminary injunction. See No. 25-5025, Doc. 2099980, at 18-21 (Feb. \n11, 2025). \nIn no sense of the term was this Court\u2019s order last night the equivalent of a preliminary \ninjunction. To provide itself a short window to more fully consider the Defendants\u2019 legal position \nbefore deciding Special Counsel Dellinger\u2019s TRO motion, this Court issued an administrative stay \nto maintain the status quo by keeping Special Counsel Dellinger in the same office he occupied at \n7:22 PM on February 7, 2025 (before the President purported to terminate him). See Minute Order, \n8:20 PM, Feb. 10, 2025. By its own terms, that abbreviated administrative stay expires \u201cmidnight \non February 13, 2025.\u201d Id. It is thus far more transient than even an ex parte TRO, which can be \n1 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 12     Filed 02/11/25     Page 3 of 8\n \nissued for up to 14 days without any right for defendants to appeal. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b)(2). \nThe Defendants are plainly mistaken in their efforts to reframe this Court\u2019s brief administrative \nstay (which expires in a few days) as a de facto preliminary injunction that decides issues of great \nsignificance and would otherwise persist for months or years through the pendency of the case. \nAlternatively, in a throw-away paragraph near the end of their brief (with no explanation \nor application of the relevant legal standard), Defendants have asked the D.C. Circuit to exercise \nits extraordinary mandamus jurisdiction. See No. 25-5025, Doc. 2099980, at 21. But neither in this \nCourt nor the D.C. Circuit have the Defendants even purported to explain how that could authorize \nthe relief they seek\u2014or why it would justify the remedy of a stay in this Court, particularly given \nthe abbreviated nature of this Court\u2019s order while the substance of the TRO motion is resolved.  \nII.  The Defendants\u2019 Litigation Conduct Undercuts Their Request    \nAlternatively, the Defendants\u2019 motion should be denied based on their own conduct in this \nlitigation. On Friday evening, the President took the unprecedented decision to terminate (in a one-\nsentence email) the Senate-confirmed head of the independent Office of Special Counsel. In so \ndoing, he violated statutory for-cause removal protections. That action broke with the position of \nPresidents of both parties, of President Bush\u2019s own Attorney General (who \u201cpledged\u201d to lobby for \nthe Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989), and of the U.S. Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal \nCounsel (which has properly distinguished the Office of Special Counsel from the agencies at issue \nin Seila Law and Collins and from the Social Security Administration). Pl. Br. at 4-7, ECF 2-1.  \nNevertheless, when called to Court, the Defendants seemed unprepared to meaningfully \nexplain or defend President Trump\u2019s conduct\u2014offering only a glancing discussion of the merits \nthat materially misstated the Executive\u2019s own history on the issue. See Feb. 10, 2025 Tr., ECF 9. \nAt that hearing, the Court made a reasonable request of the Defendants: to allow the Special \nCounsel to remain in office for a couple days while these issues are sorted. But they rejected that \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 12     Filed 02/11/25     Page 4 of 8\n \naccommodation. Instead, they proposed\u2014and the Court agreed to\u2014an expedited schedule in \nwhich the Defendants would file an opposition to Special Counsel Dellinger\u2019s TRO motion by \nnoon today. Counsel for the Defendants stated, \u201cWe can definitely make that happen and we will \ndo that.\u201d Feb. 10, 2025 Tr. at 27:23-24. With that schedule in mind, the Court made clear that it \nmight also issue an \u201can administrative stay that holds everything in abeyance until I\u2019ve had an \nopportunity at least to read that and rule on the motion for temporary restraining order.\u201d Id. at 25:8-\n11. Yet despite ample opportunity, counsel to the Defendants did not object to that specific form \nof relief (other than reiterating her general objections to a TRO). Nor did she indicate that the \nDefendants would appeal, seek mandamus, demand a stay, or otherwise seek emergency relief \nfrom the D.C. Circuit, let alone that they would do so within an hour of this Court\u2019s order.  \nThis Court acted in reasonable reliance on the Defendants\u2019 representations by allowing \nthem time to file an opposition to Mr. Dellinger\u2019s motion and granting a brief stay preserving the \nstatus quo. Based on the short-lived administrative stay timeframe and the swift deadline for the \nDefendants\u2019 opposition, this Court presumably intended to rule on the merits of Special Counsel \nDellinger\u2019s TRO motions in an expedited manner. Nevertheless, in clear disregard of this Court\u2019s \nexpedited and diligent consideration of the issues\u2014as well as its accommodation of their desire \nfor a rapid briefing schedule\u2014the Defendants have manufactured a baseless appellate emergency \nwhere none is warranted and where they cannot establish appellate jurisdiction to even press their \nposition. This unusual litigation conduct does not warrant a stay and, if anything, undercuts any \nequitable basis for relief.  \nIII.  The Defendants\u2019 Remaining Arguments Lack Merit  \nFor the reasons given in Special Counsel Dellinger\u2019s opening brief, this Court should grant \nthe TRO. Although the Defendants rely principally on Seila Law and Collins, Mot. at 2, both of \nthose cases expressly carved out the Office of Special Counsel from their holdings, Pl. Br. at 11-\n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 12     Filed 02/11/25     Page 5 of 8\n \n12; Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Fin. Prot. Bureau, 591 U.S. 197, 221 (2020); Collins v. Yellen, \n594  U.S.  220,  256  n.21  (2021).  The  Defendants  also  cite  cases  about  the  Social  Security \nAdministration, while failing to mention that the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel \nsingled out and distinguished the OSC in its discussion of statutory for-cause removal protections. \nSee Pl. Br. at 7; Constitutionality of the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s Tenure Protection, \n2021 WL 2981542, at *9 (O.L.C. July 8, 2021). More fundamentally, the Defendants hardly offer \nany response at all to the arguments set forth by Special Counsel Delinger on these points.  \nThe Defendants also echo the same points about irreparable harm that they made to this \nCourt yesterday evening, relying on a single district court case that this Court has already had an \nopportunity to consider. Mot. at 3 (citing English v. Trump, 279 F. Supp. 3d 307, 336 (D.D.C. \n2018)). Throughout American history, there have been very few circumstances (until recently) in \nwhich a President removed an agency head who enjoyed for-cause removal protections. And even \nfewer of those cases have been litigated. So there is unavoidably sparse precedent that speaks to \nthe precise question here: whether a Senate-confirmed agency head who is terminated in violation \nof for-cause removal protections can obtain any interim relief while litigating their case in court.  \nStill, as explained in Special Counsel Dellinger\u2019s TRO brief and at the hearing, there are \nmultiple, independent bases for irreparable harm here. First, he has been deprived of his statutory \nright to function in his office, following the appointment of the President and confirmation by the \nSenate to an office with for-cause removal protections. Br. 15-16; Berry v. Reagan, No. 83-3182, \n1983 WL 538, at *5 (D.D.C. Nov. 14, 1983), vacated as moot, 732 F.2d 949 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (per \ncuriam); Mackie v. Bush, 809 F. Supp. 144, 147 (D.D.C. 1993), vacated as moot sub nom. Mackie \nv. Clinton, 10 F.3d 13 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (per curiam). The distinctions that the Defendants seek to \ndraw miss the crucial point: that the unlawful removal of an agency head who has been confirmed \nand vested with authority to carry out certain functions inflicts a distinct injury to that official by \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 12     Filed 02/11/25     Page 6 of 8\n \ndepriving him of his ability to carry out the statutorily vested functions that he has personally been \ncharged with performing. The Defendants\u2019 reliance on cases involving private employment and \nmore junior executive branch personnel is thus misplaced. When the President nominates and the \nSenate confirms a person to execute specific official functions, and that person is unlawfully fired, \nthey suffer an immediate and irreparable loss of their legally vested right to personally function in \nthat agency leadership position. \n Second, accepting the Defendants\u2019 view of irreparable injury would effectively nullify the \nvalue of any statutory for-cause provision, including that applicable to Special Counsel Dellinger. \nIf the President can unlawfully fire officials despite for-cause removal protections, and the fired \nofficials cannot receive any judicial remedy until months or years later\u2014following the resolution \nof full merits proceedings (and potentially any appeals)\u2014then for-cause removal protections are \nworth precious little, and the century of ink and energy that have been devoted to establishing \nagency independence has been largely in vain. (The Defendants now assert that illegally fired \nofficials can never be reinstated, and instead can only receive backpay, which would truly drain \nfor-cause removal protections of their purpose.) The oddity of this view, which would render for-\ncause removal protections granted to Senate-confirmed officials such as Special counsel Dellinger \nof little practical import, and which would undermine a major premise of agency independence \n(reassuring agency heads that they can function in office with a measure of protection from direct \npresidential control), counsels forcefully against accepting it here.   \nThird, and finally, removal of the Special Counsel, especially at this pivotal point in time, \ncould cause irreparable harm to the functioning of the OSC, a small agency in which the Special \nCounsel plays a singular role in ensuring the protection of whistleblowers and their confidentiality \nas required by statute. Br. 15-16; Feb. Tr. at 18:14-20:1; e.g., 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1212(h).  \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 12     Filed 02/11/25     Page 7 of 8\n \nIndeed, the irreparable harm to Special Counsel Dellinger in both his personal and official \ncapacity is even more obvious now than it was yesterday. The President has already developed a \ntrack record of removing independent agency heads (whether lawfully or unlawfully) and then \nappointing an acting head in their place, only for the acting head to bring the agency\u2019s work to an \nimmediate (and possibly indefinite) halt. See, e.g., Stacy Cowley, Confusion Reigns as \u2018a Wrecking \nBall\u2019 Hits the Consumer Bureau, N.Y. Times (Feb. 10, 2025).1 Last night, the President purported \nto appoint a new Acting Special Counsel to lead the Office of Special Counsel. See Chris Cameron, \nA judge blocked Trump\u2019s firing of a government watchdog, N.Y. Times (Feb. 10, 2025).2 That \ndecision directly contradicts a key premise for the Defendants\u2019 arguments against irreparable harm, \nwhich was that the OSC could continue to function smoothly because the Special Counsel would \nbe replaced in the interim by the Acting Special Counsel, a career Principal Deputy Special \nCounsel. See Feb. 10 Tr. at 4:2-4, 26:10-14. Now, instead, the President has purportedly named as \nActing Special Counsel Doug Collins\u2014who is somehow expected also to serve as the Senate-\nconfirmed Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs and as the new Acting Director of the \nOffice of Government Ethics. These actions present a clear and immediate threat to the OSC\u2019s \nfunctioning at a time that its statutory role in protecting whistleblowers is most needed. And that \ninjury is properly asserted by Special Counsel Dellinger: in assessing irreparable injury, the Court \nassumes that the plaintiff will prevail on the merits, and thus Special Counsel Dellinger may rightly \nassert injuries that will befall him personally as well as the agency he is charged with leading.   \nFinally, the Defendants claim that by allowing Special Counsel Dellinger to remain in \noffice on an interim basis, this Court has worked an \u201cintrusion into the President\u2019s authority to \n \n1 Available at https://www.nytimes.com/2025/02/10/business/cfpb-shutdown-confusion.html. \n2 Available at https://www.nytimes.com/live/2025/02/10/us/trump-news?smid=url-share#a-\njudge-blocked-trumps-firing-of-a-government-watchdog. \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 12     Filed 02/11/25     Page 8 of 8\n \nexercise \u201call of\u201d \u201cthe \u2018executive Power\u2019\u201d of the United States.\u201d Mot. at 2-3 (quoting Seila Law, \n590 U.S. at 203). But this both confuses the likelihood of success on the merits factor with the \nirreparable harm factor of the stay analysis, and fails to make any showing of actual irreparable \nharm. Whether Congress\u2019 determination to grant the Special Counsel for-cause protection in the \nCSRA is an affront to \u201cthe constitutional separation of powers\u201d is a question for the Court\u2019s \nanalysis of the merits. Moreover, the Defendants make no serious attempt to detail what actual \nharm will result from Mr. Dellinger continuing to function as Special Counsel while this Court \nrules on the pending TRO application. This lack of harm further follows from the Defendants\u2019 \neffective concession that there is no basis on which to terminate Mr. Dellinger for cause. \nThus, Special Counsel Dellinger respectfully requests that the stay motion be denied. \n \n  Respectfully submitted,  \n \n \n  /s/ Joshua A.

Given \nthe grave harm to the separation of powers the district court\u2019s order works, \nthe government seeks a stay of the order pending disposition of this appeal, \nand respectfully requests an immediate administrative stay. \nThe Supreme Court has made clear\u2014twice, and recently\u2014that Article \nII precludes Congress from placing limits on the President\u2019s authority to re-\nmove principal officers of the United States who serve as sole heads of an \nExecutive Branch agency.  Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (2021); Seila Law LLC \nv. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020).  In Seila Law, the Court invalidated the statutory \nrestrictions on removal of the Director of the Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau (CFPB), and in Collins, the Court explained that Seila Law was \u201call \nbut dispositive\u201d as to the invalidity of similar restrictions on the removal of \nthe Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) Director, explaining that \u201c[t]he \nFHFA (like the CFPB) is an agency led by a single Director.\u201d  Collins, 594 U.S. \nat 250-251.  Consistent with those holdings, President Biden exercised his \nconstitutional authority to remove the Commissioner of Social Security in \n \n\n2021; the only courts of appeals to have addressed the constitutionality of \nthat removal have sustained it.  Rodriguez v. SSA, 118 F.4th 1302, 1313-1314 \n(11th Cir. 2024); Kaufmann v. Kijakazi, 32 F.4th 843, 848-849 (9th Cir. 2022). \nIn this case, the President exercised the same authority recognized in \nSeila Law and Collins, and exercised by President Biden, by removing Hamp-\nton Dellinger as the head of the Office of Special Counsel (OSC)\u2014an Execu-\ntive Branch agency with a single head, just like the CFPB, FHFA, and Social \nSecurity Administration.  This should not have been a constitutionally con-\ntroversial act.  Dellinger\u2019s removal was consistent with a longstanding Exec-\nutive Branch view, dating to the creation of OSC during the Carter Admin-\nistration, that removal protections for the Special Counsel are constitution-\nally dubious.  The Supreme Court recently noted the lack of historical prec-\nedent for the Special Counsel\u2019s removal protections, describing OSC as a \nnovelty\u2014\u201ccreated nearly 200 years after the Constitution was ratified,\u201d even \nthough no other \u201cenduring single-leader office\u201d had been established during \nthat time\u2014and noted that it \u201cdrew a contemporaneous constitutional objec-\ntion from the Office of Legal Counsel under President Carter.\u201d  Seila Law, 591 \nU.S. at 221.  And in Collins, when the government argued to the Supreme \nCourt that the FHFA Director must be removable at will under Seila Law, it \n- 2 - \n\nnoted that the same would be true of the Special Counsel.  Reply and Re-\nsponse Br. for the Federal Parties, Collins v. Mnuchin, Nos. 19-422, 19-563, \n2020 WL 6322317, at *26 (U.S. Oct. 23, 2020). \nYet the district court\u2014just hours after Dellinger brought this suit to \nchallenge his removal, and before the government had even had the oppor-\ntunity to respond to his motion for a temporary restraining order\u2014issued \nwhat it characterized as an \u201cadministrative stay\u201d restoring Dellinger to the \noffice from which the President had removed him, enjoining any efforts to \nimpede his \u201caccess to the resources or materials of that office,\u201d and barring \nthe installation of \u201cany other person as Special Counsel.\u201d \nNotwithstanding the district court\u2019s attempts to frame it as modest, \nthis order is an extraordinary\u2014indeed, unprecedented\u2014intrusion into the \nPresident\u2019s  authority  to  exercise  \u201call  of\u201d  \u201cthe  \u2018executive  Power\u2019\u201d  of  the \nUnited States, Seila Law, 590 U.S. at 203.  The government is unaware of any \nother occasion in American history where a federal court has purported to \nreinstall a principal officer of the United States after the President has re-\nmoved him\u2014let alone to do so without finding that he was likely to prevail \non the merits of his claim, as the district court did here.  Indeed, even if re-\ninstatement were a permissible remedy for an unlawful removal, the district \n- 3 - \n\ncourt gravely erred in ordering that remedy on an interim basis given the \nabsence of any irreparable harm to Dellinger, on the one hand, and the po-\ntential disruption and damage to Executive Branch functions resulting from \nthe judicially compelled reinstatement of a principal officer of the United \nStates over the objection of the President, on the other.  This is not merely an \nabstract interference with Executive Branch prerogatives, but involves com-\npelling the government to provide access to investigative files, while imped-\ning the rightful Acting Special Counsel from faithfully executing the laws.     \nThis Court should stay the district court\u2019s order and should grant an \nimmediate administrative stay pending consideration of this motion.  In the \nalternative, to the extent the Court harbors doubt about its appellate juris-\ndiction, it should treat this motion as a petition for a writ of mandamus and \nshould grant a writ directing the district court to vacate its order. \nSTATEMENT \nA.  Statutory Background \nCongress created the Office of the Special Counsel in the Civil Service \nReform Act of 1978.  Pub. L. No. 95-454, \u00a7 202(a), 92 Stat. 1111, 1122.  The Act \nauthorized the Special Counsel to receive and investigate \u201cany allegation of \na prohibited personnel practice,\u201d 92 Stat. at 1125, and to request corrective \n- 4 - \n\naction from the Merit Systems Protection Board in cases where agency heads \ndeclined to correct impermissible practices, id. at 1127, among other powers.  \nThe Act provided that the Special Counsel could \u201cbe removed by the Presi-\ndent only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d  Id. \nFrom the beginning, the Executive Branch objected to the constitution-\nality of that removal restriction.  In a published opinion, the Carter Admin-\nistration\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel explained that \u201c[b]ecause the Special \nCounsel [would] be performing largely executive functions, the Congress \n[could] not restrict the President\u2019s power to remove him.\u201d  Memorandum \nOpinion for the General Counsel, Civil Service Commission, 2 Op. OLC 120, 122 \n(1978); see Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 221 (noting this \u201ccontemporaneous constitu-\ntional objection\u201d).  And when Congress passed an initial version of the Whis-\ntleblower Protection Act in 1988, separating OSC from the Merit Systems \nProtection Board and vesting OSC with additional powers, President Reagan \npocket-vetoed the legislation, explaining that it \u201craised serious constitu-\ntional concerns\u201d by, among other things, \u201cpurport[ing] to insulate the Office \nfrom presidential supervision and to limit the power of the President to re-\nmove his subordinates from office.\u201d  Public Papers of the Presidents, Ronald \n- 5 - \n\nReagan, Vol. II, Oct. 26, 1988, pp. 1391\u20131392 (1991); see Seila Law, 591 U.S. at \n221 (citing this \u201cveto on constitutional grounds\u201d). \nCongress ultimately passed a revised version of the Whistleblower \nProtection Act that separated the OSC from the Merit Systems Protection \nBoard while removing certain of the additional powers that the initial ver-\nsion would have granted the Office.  Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, \nPub. L. No. 101-12, 103 Stat. 16.  President George H.W. Bush signed that bill, \nnotwithstanding its maintenance of the restrictions on removal of the Special \nCounsel.  But the Executive Branch did not recede from its constitutional \nobjection to Congress\u2019s placement of restrictions on the removal of agency \nheads.  In 1994, for example, the Office of Legal Counsel advised President \nClinton \u201cthat the [Social Security Administration]\u2019s new structure as an \nagency led by a single person with tenure protection was \u2018extraordinary\u2019\u201d \nand that the tenure protection presented a \u201c\u2018serious constitutional question\u2019\u201d \nbecause it \u201c\u2018would severely erode the President\u2019s authority.\u2019\u201d  Constitution-\nality of the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s Tenure Protection, 45 Op. O.L.C. __, \n2021 WL 2981542, at *2 (O.L.C. July 8, 2021) (quoting Letter for Lloyd N. Cut-\nler, Counsel to the President, from Walter Dellinger, Assistant Attorney Gen-\neral, Office of Legal Counsel (July 29, 1994)). \n- 6 - \n\nToday, OSC exercises essentially the same powers as it originally pos-\nsessed.  The Special Counsel is vested with an array of executive powers and \nfunctions.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1212.  The Special Counsel\u2019s responsibilities include \ninvestigating  allegations  of  prohibited  personnel  practices,  5  U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1214(a)(1)(A), and initiating disciplinary actions through the filing of com-\nplaints before the Merit Systems Protection Board, see id. \u00a7 1215(a)(1). \nB.  This Litigation \nHampton Dellinger was appointed by President Biden and confirmed \nby the Senate to serve as Special Counsel, beginning in March 2024.  Dkt. 1 \n\u00b6 1.  On February 7, 2025, the Director of the White House Presidential Per-\nsonnel Office informed Dellinger that the President had removed him from \noffice effective immediately.  Id. \u00b6 2. \nYesterday, Dellinger brought this suit to challenge his removal, Dkt. 1, \nand moved for a temporary restraining order, Dkt. 2.  Upon receiving the \nmotion, the district court set a near-immediate hearing, before the govern-\nment had responded to the motion for a temporary restraining order.  Sev-\neral hours later, the court entered what it described as \u201ca brief administrative \nstay,\u201d reasoning that the stay was necessary \u201cto preserve the status quo.\u201d  \n- 7 - \n\nThe court\u2019s order restored Dellinger to the office of Special Counsel and en-\njoined defendants from \u201cdeny[ing] him access to the resources or materials \nof that office or recogniz[ing] the authority of any other person as Special \nCounsel.\u201d \nThe government filed a notice of appeal and a motion to stay the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s order pending appeal.  The district court has not yet ruled on \nthat motion; if it does so, we will promptly notify this Court. \nARGUMENT \nIn  considering  a  stay  pending  appeal,  this  Court  examines \n\u201c\u2018(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely \nto succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured \nabsent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the \nother parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest \nlies.\u2019\u201d  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 426 (2009). \nA.  The Government Is Likely To Prevail On The Merits. \nOSC is an Executive Branch agency \u201cheaded by a single officer,\u201d Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 221.  As described above, from the time OSC was first created \nin 1978, and across several administrations in the years since, the Executive \n- 8 - \n\nBranch has expressed doubt as to whether Congress may preclude the Pres-\nident from removing the Special Counsel at will.  Over the past five years, \nSupreme Court precedent has definitively resolved that question in the neg-\native.  Officials vested with sole responsibility for overseeing the exercise of \nexecutive power must be directly answerable to the President.   \n1.  At-will removal is the general rule, and OSC does \nnot fit within any exceptions. \nArticle II of the Constitution provides that \u201cthe \u2018executive Power\u2019\u2014all \nof it\u2014is \u2018vested in a President,\u2019 who must \u2018take Care that the Laws be faith-\nfully executed.\u2019\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 203 (quoting U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 1, cl. \n1; id. \u00a7 3).  To discharge those responsibilities, the President \u201cas a general \nmatter\u201d has \u201cauthority to remove those who assist him in carrying out his \nduties.\u201d  Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Accounting Oversight Board, 561 U.S. \n477, 513-514 (2010).  \u201cWithout such power, the President could not be held \nfully accountable for discharging his own responsibilities; the buck would \nstop somewhere else.\u201d  Id. at 514; see also, e.g., Exela Enter. Sols., Inc. v. NLRB, \n32 F.4th 436, 445 (5th Cir. 2022) (\u201cThe President's power to remove is essen-\ntial to the performance of his Article II responsibilities and control over the \nExecutive Branch.\u201d).  \n- 9 - \n\nThe Supreme Court has \u201crecognized only two exceptions to the Presi-\ndent\u2019s unrestricted removal power.\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 203.  First, in \nHumphrey\u2019s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), the Court held that \nCongress could \u201cgive for-cause removal protections to a multimember body \nof experts, balanced along partisan lines, that performed legislative and ju-\ndicial functions and was said not to exercise any executive power.\u201d  Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 216.  Second, the Court has held that \u201cCongress could pro-\nvide tenure protections to certain inferior officers with narrowly defined du-\nties.\u201d  Id. at 204. \nThe Special Counsel does not fit within either of these exceptions.  He \nis not an inferior officer with narrowly defined duties; he is a principal of-\nficer appointed by the President with Senate confirmation, see U.S. Const. \nart. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2; 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b), who oversees his own Department and is \nnot subservient to any other principal officer, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1211-1212.  See \nalso Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 511 (explaining that a Department \u201cis a \nfreestanding component of the Executive Branch, not subordinate to or con-\ntained within any other such component\u201d).  Nor does the Special Counsel \nwork as part of a \u201cmultimember expert agency,\u201d Seila Law LLC, 591 U.S. at \n218; he serves as the sole head of his agency, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(a). \n- 10 - \n\n2.  Heads  of  single-member  Executive  departments \nmust be removable at will by the President. \nFive years ago, the Supreme Court surveyed the Executive Branch and \nidentified  only  four  then-existing  examples  of  single-member  agencies \nwhose heads were afforded protection against at-will removal.  See Seila Law, \n591 U.S. at 290-292.  As described below, the Supreme Court has now itself \ninvalidated the removal protections for two of these agencies (the CFPB and \nthe FHFA).  The Office of Legal Counsel and two courts of appeals have con-\ncluded that the removal protections for a third (the Social Security Admin-\nistration) are likewise invalid.  The Office of Special Counsel is the fourth.    \nIn Seila Law, the Supreme Court invalidated the removal restrictions \nfor the Director of the CFPB, explaining that the \u201csingle-Director structure \ncontravenes\u201d the Constitution\u2019s \u201ccarefully calibrated system by vesting sig-\nnificant governmental power in the hands of a single individual accountable \nto no one.\u201d  591 U.S. at 224.  When the Founders chose to vest executive au-\nthority in a single person, the Court explained, they ensured that the Presi-\ndent would be \u201cthe most democratic and politically accountable official in \nGovernment \u2026 elected by the entire Nation.\u201d  Id.  Thus, while executive of-\nficers assist the President in carrying out his responsibilities, they \u201cremain[] \n- 11 - \n\nsubject to the ongoing supervision and control of the elected President.\u201d  Id.  \nBy contrast, the CFPB Director could \u201cunilaterally, without meaningful su-\npervision, issue final regulations, oversee adjudications, set enforcement pri-\norities, initiate prosecutions, and determine what penalties to impose,\u201d id. at \n225, while the President was constrained to permit the Director to do so ab-\nsent  \u201cinefficiency,  neglect  of  duty,  or  malfeasance  in  office,\u201d  12  U.S.C. \n\u00a7 5491(c)(3).  The Court held that restriction unconstitutional, concluding \nthat \u201cprincipal officers who, acting alone, wield significant executive power\u201d \nmust be removable at will by the President.  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 238.  \nThe Supreme Court applied the same logic when it invalidated the \u201cfor \ncause\u201d removal restriction for the Director of the FHFA.  Collins, 594 U.S. at \n226-228.  The Court explained that Seila Law was \u201call but dispositive,\u201d as the \nFHFA was \u201can agency led by a single Director\u201d for whom Congress had \u201cre-\nstrict[ed] the President\u2019s removal power.\u201d  Id. at 250-251.  In doing so, the \nCourt rejected an argument that the FHFA should be treated differently be-\ncause it did not exercise as much executive authority as the CFPB did.  Id. at \n251.  \u201c[T]he nature and breadth of an agency\u2019s authority is not dispositive,\u201d \nthe Court explained, \u201cin determining whether Congress may limit the Pres-\nident\u2019s power to remove its head.\u201d  Id. at 251-252.  The key purpose of the \n- 12 - \n\nremoval power is to ensure that \u201cExecutive Branch actions\u201d are subject \u201cto a \ndegree  of  electoral  accountability,\u201d  which  is  \u201cimplicated  whenever  an \nagency does important work.\u201d  Id. at 252.  Collins thus declined to carve out \nan exception to the general rule of at-will removal based on \u201cthe relative \nimportance of the regulatory and enforcement authority of disparate agen-\ncies.\u201d  Id. at 253. \nIn the wake of Seila Law and Collins, President Biden removed the \nCommissioner of Social Security without cause, contrary to the statutory \nlimitations that restricted removal of that agency head except for \u201cneglect of \nduty or malfeasance in office.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(a)(3).  In supporting the le-\ngality of that decision, the Department of Justice explained that \u201cthe best \nreading of Collins and Seila Law\u201d led to the conclusion that \u201cthe President \nneed not heed the Commissioner\u2019s statutory tenure protection.\u201d  Constitu-\ntionality of the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s Tenure Protection, 2021 WL \n2981542, at *1, 7.  The only courts of appeals to have considered the ques-\ntion\u2014the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits\u2014have both concluded that the re-\nmoval restrictions for the single-headed Social Security Administration are \nunconstitutional.  Rodriguez, 118 F.4th at 1313-1314; Kaufmann, 32 F.4th at \n848-849. \n- 13 - \n\nOSC is indistinguishable from the other single-headed agencies iden-\ntified in Seila Law.  There is no doubt that the Special Counsel exercises exec-\nutive authority:  He may \u201cinvestigate allegations of prohibited personnel \npractices,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1212(a)(2); \u201cbring actions concerning allegations of vi-\nolations of other laws within the jurisdiction of\u201d his office, id. \u00a7 1212(a)(4); \nissue subpoenas, id. \u00a7 1212(b)(2)(A); intervene in other proceedings before \nthe  Merit  Systems  Protection  Board,  id.  \u00a7 1212(c)(1);  appoint  others,  id. \n\u00a7 1212(d)(1); prescribe regulations, id. \u00a7 1212(e); appear in federal court as an \namicus curiae, id. \u00a7 1212(h)(1); and bring disciplinary actions against federal \nemployees, id. \u00a7 1215(a)(1).  These are core executive functions.  See, e.g., Ri-\neth-Riley Constr. Co. v. NLRB, 114 F.4th 519, 531 (6th Cir. 2024) (recognizing \nin the context of the NLRB General Counsel that \u201c[t]he authority to initiate \nor dismiss complaints is a purely executive, not judicial, function\u201d and \u201cis \nsquarely on the prosecutorial side of the \u2018prosecutorial versus adjudicatory \nline\u2019\u201d).    \nThe exercise of those duties clearly implicates the faithful execution of \nfederal law.  When Congress first created OSC in 1978, the Carter Admin-\nistration objected and explained that \u201cCongress may not properly limit the \ngrounds for removal of the Special Counsel by the President,\u201d because the \n- 14 - \n\nSpecial Counsel \u201cmust be removable at will.\u201d  Memorandum Opinion for the \nGeneral Counsel, Civil Service Commission, 2 Op. OLC at 120.  That is because \n\u201cthe Special Counsel\u2019s functions are executive in character,\u201d and his \u201crole in \ninvestigating and prosecuting prohibited practices is much the same as that \nof a U.S. Attorney or other Federal prosecutors,\u201d which \u201care directed at the \nenforcement of the laws.\u201d  Id.  Even at that time, before Seila Law and Collins, \nit was clear that Humphrey\u2019s Executor did \u201cnot extend to an officer appointed \nby the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, who performs \npredominantly  executive  functions  and  who,  by  reason  of  the  statutory \nscheme, is independent of the quasi-judicial process.\u201d  Id. at 122.  And Pres-\nident Reagan reiterated those \u201cserious constitutional concerns\u201d about the \nSpecial Counsel\u2019s insulation from electoral accountability.  See Public Papers \nof the Presidents, Ronald Reagan, Vol. II, Oct. 26, 1988, pp. 1391\u20131392 (1991).  \nThe Court in Seila Law expressly noted these objections in explaining that \nthere was no historical pedigree for single-member agency heads with re-\nmoval protections.  591 U.S. at 221. \n- 15 - \n\n3.  Dellinger  cannot  show  entitlement  to  reinstate-\nment.  \nIf that were not enough, Dellinger is deeply mistaken in seeking judi-\ncial reinstatement to a principal office.  When principal officers have been \nremoved from their posts, they have challenged that removal in suits for \nback pay.  See Humphrey\u2019s Executor, 295 U.S. at 612 (challenge sought \u201cto re-\ncover a sum of money alleged to be due\u201d); Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, \n106 (1926) (same); Wiener v. United States, 357 U.S. 349, 349-351 (1958) (same).  \nThe President cannot be compelled to retain the services of a principal officer \nwhom the President no longer believes should be entrusted with the exercise \nof executive power.  Such a remedy would undermine the objective of elec-\ntoral accountability within the Executive Branch that animated the holdings \nin Seila Law and Collins. \nB.  The Equitable Factors Favor A Stay. \nThe equitable factors likewise weigh decisively in the government\u2019s \nfavor, and \u201cthe public interest and balance of equities factors merge\u201d where, \nas here, \u201cthe government is the party\u201d against whom an injunction is sought, \nMediNatura, Inc. v. FDA, 998 F.3d 931, 945 (D.C. Cir. 2021). \n- 16 - \n\n1.  As discussed above, the district court\u2019s order works an extraor-\ndinary harm to the President\u2019s authority to exercise \u201call of\u201d \u201cthe \u2018executive \nPower\u2019\u201d of the United States, Seila Law, 590 U.S. at 203.  Because of that order, \na person the President has chosen to remove from office is exercising execu-\ntive power over the President\u2019s objection.  That sort of harm to the Executive, \nand to the constitutional separation of powers, is transparently irreparable. \n2.  Conversely, a stay is not necessary to prevent any cognizable \nharm to Dellinger.  See English v. Trump, 279 F. Supp. 3d 307, 336 (D.D.C. \n2018) (no irreparable harm to plaintiff who alleged that she had wrongfully \nbeen  prevented  from  serving  as  Acting  CFPB  Director).    Because  the \n\u201c[g]overnment has traditionally been granted the widest latitude in the \u2018dis-\npatch of its own internal affairs,\u2019\u201d only in a \u201cgenuinely extraordinary situa-\ntion\u201d may loss of employment constitute irreparable harm.  Sampson v. Mur-\nray, 415 U.S. 61, 83, 92 & n.68 (1974).  Loss of income or reputation do not \nconstitute extraordinary circumstances.  See id. at 89-92, 92 n.68.  And to the \nextent Dellinger asserts irreparable harm to the functioning of OSC itself, \nthat assertion is misplaced, both because OSC can continue to function with \nan Acting Special Counsel (who had already assumed Dellinger\u2019s role before \n- 17 - \n\nthe district court\u2019s order) and because Dellinger would lack standing to raise \nsuch a harm. \nC.  This Court Has Jurisdiction. \nFinally, this Court has jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s order.  \nDespite the court\u2019s characterization of the order as an \u201cadministrative stay,\u201d \nit is in substance a temporary restraining order, and temporary restraining \norders are appealable where, as here, they are akin to injunctions within the \nmeaning of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). \n1.  The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide for only two forms \nof provisional injunctive relief: preliminary injunctions, which require \u201cno-\ntice to the adverse party,\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a); and temporary restraining \norders, which do not require notice and which are meant only to prevent \n\u201cimmediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage\u201d that \u201cwill result to the \nmovant before the adverse party can be heard in opposition,\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. \n(b)(1)(A).  Crucially, both forms of relief require the movant to satisfy the \nfour-factor standard articulated in Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Coun-\ncil, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).  See, e.g., American Ass\u2019n of Pol. Consultants v. \nSmall Bus. Admin., 810 F. App\u2019x 8, 9 (D.C. Cir. 2020). \n- 18 - \n\nIn this case, however, the district court entered a novel form of relief \nthat several other district courts have also entered in recent cases\u2014a so-\ncalled \u201cadministrative stay.\u201d  Administrative stays have a proper role in ap-\npellate litigation, when a district court has entered an injunction and an ap-\npellate court stays it briefly to \u201cbuy[] \u2026 time to deliberate.\u201d  United States v. \nTexas, 144 S. Ct. 797, 798 (2024) (Barrett, J., concurring in denial of applica-\ntions to vacate stay).  But what the district court entered here was not a stay \nof an injunction it had previously entered; it was itself an injunction, barring \nthe government from interfering with Dellinger\u2019s exercise of a role from \nwhich the President had removed him. \nThe justification the district court gave for its anomalous manner of \nproceeding was that it was necessary to preserve the status quo until the \ngovernment could respond to Dellinger\u2019s motion and the court could resolve \nthat motion on the merits.  But as discussed above, that situation\u2014where a \nlitigant seeks a provisional form of injunctive relief before the other side can \nbe heard\u2014is exactly the situation in which the Federal Rules provide for a \ntemporary restraining order.  What the district court should have done, if it \nwas concerned about the need for relief before the government could be \nheard, was to determine whether Dellinger could satisfy the demanding \n- 19 - \n\nfour-factor standard for issuance of a temporary restraining order.  The court \nwas not permitted to issue any form of injunctive relief without addressing \nthe Winter factors.  This Court should therefore consider the order to be a \ntemporary restraining order, albeit one issued without the requisite analysis. \n2.  Although temporary restraining orders are ordinarily not ap-\npealable, they are appealable where they are \u201cmore akin to preliminary in-\njunctive relief.\u201d  Garza v. Hargan, 2017 WL 9854552, at *1 n.1 (D.C. Cir. Oct. \n20, 2017), vacated in part on reh\u2019g en banc, 874 F.3d 735 (D.C. Cir. 2017), vacated \nsub nom. Azar v. Garza, 584 U.S. 726 (2018); see Belbacha v. Bush, 520 F.3d 452, \n455 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (treating denial of temporary restraining order as \u201c\u2018tan-\ntamount to denial of a preliminary injunction\u2019\u201d).  Indeed, the Supreme Court \nhas stressed that a district court cannot \u201cshield its orders from appellate re-\nview merely by designating them as temporary restraining orders, rather \nthan as preliminary injunctions.\u201d  Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 86-87 \n(1974).  Here, the putatively administrative nature of the district court\u2019s ac-\ntion  cannot  obscure  the  extraordinary  nature  of  what  the  court  has  or-\ndered:  the restoration to office of a principal officer of the United States, over \nthe objection of the President of the United States.  The government is una-\nware of any prior instance in American history in which a federal court has \n- 20 - \n\nissued such an injunction.  And that is what it is\u2014an injunction.  It does not \nmerely pause the status quo (for example, by barring further action by the \nOffice of Special Counsel pending resolution of this matter), but awards a \nportion of the very relief plaintiff seeks on the merits:  the right to resume \nexercising the executive power of the United States, free from policy control \nby the Chief Executive.  That the order is time-limited does not make it any \nless remarkable as a matter of law, nor does it diminish the intrusion that the \ndistrict court has authorized into the President\u2019s Article II authority for each \npassing day.  Because the district court\u2019s \u201cadministrative stay\u201d effects imme-\ndiate, irreparable harm on the Executive Branch, it is an injunction and is \nappealable as such under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1).   \n3.  Even if this Court were to conclude that the order is unappeala-\nble, the Court should exercise its discretion to treat this motion as a petition \nfor writ of mandamus.  Ukiah Adventist Hosp. v. FTC, 981 F.2d 543, 548 n.6 \n(D.C. Cir. 1992).  The district court\u2019s extraordinary order readily satisfies the \nstandard to grant mandamus.  See Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Court for D.C., 542 U.S. \n367, 380-381 (2004). \n- 21 - \n\nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should stay the district court\u2019s order pending appeal.  To \npermit the orderly briefing and disposition of this motion, the Court should \ngrant temporary administrative relief while it considers the motion.  And to \nthe extent the Court harbors any doubt about its appellate jurisdiction, it \nshould treat this motion as a petition for a writ of mandamus and grant a \nwrit directing the district court to vacate its order. \nRespectfully submitted, \n  BRETT A.

(Court Reporter Janice\nDickman.) (zdrf) (Entered: 02/10/2025)\n\n02/10/2025 MINUTE ORDER. Pending before the Court is plaintiff's motion for a Temporary\nRestraining Order 2 . The Court received the motion shortly after it was docketed and\nassigned this morning, and it was occupied with another hearing for most of the day,\nso it set a scheduling conference for 4:30 p.m. At the hearing, counsel for the\ndefendants represented that they did not receive the motion until the early afternoon\nand had not yet had an opportunity to file a response. Counsel also indicated that the\ndefendants were unable to take a position as to whether they would be willing to freeze\nthe firing until the Court resolved the legal issues. The Court heard some argument\nfrom both sides with respect to the factors it must consider in connection with the\nmotion, and it appreciates the fact that the lawyers were both ready to address them\norally, at least in part, this afternoon. But the Court has not yet had the benefit of a\nwritten submission by the defendants. Therefore, the defendants' opposition to the\nmotion will be due by noon tomorrow, February 11, 2025. Give the Court's concerns\nabout the potential irreparable harm occasioned by the challenged firing of the Special\nCounsel, a Presidential appointee confirmed by the Senate to serve a 5\u2212year term who\n\"may be removed by the President only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or\nmalfeasance,\" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b), and given the significant statutory and\nconstitutional issues involved, the Court will defer ruling on the motion until after it\nhas received and considered the defendants' submission. In the interim, though, to\npreserve the status quo \u2212\u2212 which the D.C. Circuit has described as \"the regime in\nplace\" before the challenged action, Huisha\u2212Huisha v. Mayorkas, 27 F.4th 718,\n733\u221234 (D.C. Cir. 2022), or \"the last uncontested status which preceded the pending\ncontroversy,\" id., quoting District 50, United Mine Workers of America v.\nInternational Union, United Mine Workers of America, 412 F.2d 165, 168 (D.C. Cir.\n1969) \u2212\u2212 the Court will issue a brief administrative stay. An administrative stay \"buys\nthe court time to deliberate\": it \"do[es] not typically reflect the court's consideration of\nthe merits,\" but instead \"reflects a first\u2212blush judgment about the relative\nconsequences\" of the case. United States v. Texas, 144 S. Ct. 797, 798 (2024) (Barret,\nJ., concurring). While administrative stays are more common in appellate courts,\ndistrict courts have recognized their applicability in cases seeking emergency relief \u2212\nincluding in this District. See National Council of Nonprofits v. Office of Management\n& Budget, No. 25\u2212CV\u2212239, 2025 WL 314433 (D.D.C. Jan. 28, 2025); Order, Texas v.\nDepartment of Homeland Security, No. 24\u2212CV\u2212306 (E.D. Tex. Aug. 26, 2024); Chef\nTime 1520 LLC v. Small Business Administration, No. 22\u2212CV\u22123587 (D.D.C. Dec. 1,\n2022). As these courts have recognized, the \"[t]he authority for an administrative stay\narises from the All Writs Act and a court's inherent authority to manage its docket.\"\nOrder, Texas, No. 24\u2212CV\u2212306, at 2. Therefore, it is HEREBY ORDERED that from\nthe time of this order through midnight on February 13, 2025, plaintiff Hampton\nDellinger shall continue to serve as the Special Counsel of the Office of Special\nCounsel, the position he occupied at 7:22 p.m. on Friday, February 7, 2025 when he\nreceived an email from the President, and the defendants may not deny him access to\nthe resources or materials of that office or recognize the authority of any other person\nas Special Counsel. This period may only be extended by further order of the Court.\nSO ORDERED. Signed by Judge Amy Berman Jackson on 2/10/2025.

Barrett Prettyman U.S. Courthouse \n333 Constitution Avenue NW \nWashington, D.C. 20001 \n \nRE:  Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5025 \n \nDear Mr. Cislak: \n \nI write with two updates for the motions panel.  First, the President \nyesterday  named  Doug  Collins,  Secretary  of  Veterans  Affairs,  as \nActing Special Counsel.  The district court\u2019s order is thus irreparably \nharming the President by preventing him from installing his preferred \ndesignee as the acting head of an Executive Branch agency headed by \na single individual. \nSecond, we wish to correct imprecise statements in our stay motion, \nfiled this morning, that the government was unaware of any prior \ninstance in which a federal court ordered the restoration to office of a \nprincipal officer of the United States after the President had removed \nthe  officer.   See  Mot. 3, 20-21.  More precisely, the government is \nunaware of any prior instance in which a federal court ordered the \nreinstatement of the principal officer of a single-headed agency after \nthe President had removed the officer. \nWe  are,  however,  aware  of  one  instance  in  which  a  district  court \neffectively reinstated members of a multimember commission who \nhad been removed.  In Berry v. Reagan, 1983 WL 538 (D.D.C. Nov. 14, \n\n1983), the district court preliminarily enjoined the government from \n\u201cpreventing or interfering with\u201d the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cservice as members of \nthe U.S. Commission on Civil Rights\u201d after the President had removed \nthem from that body.  Part of the district court\u2019s reasoning was that the \nCommission\u2019s  \u201c\u2018only  purpose\u2019\u201d  was  \u201c\u2018to  find  facts  which  [could] \nsubsequently be used as a basis for legislative or executive action,\u2019\u201d \nleading  the  district  court  to  express  an  understanding  that  the \nCommission functioned as a \u201clegislative agency.\u201d  Id. at *2.  This Court \nlater  vacated  the  district  court\u2019s  judgment  and  remanded  for  the \ndistrict court \u201cto dismiss the suit as moot\u201d after the expiration of \u201cthe \nstatutory period for the existence of\u201d the Commission.  Berry v. Reagan, \n732 F.2d 949, 949 (D.C. Cir. 1983) (per curiam). \nWe regret the imprecision and would appreciate your circulating this \nletter to the members of the motions panel. \nSincerely,  \n \n/s/ Daniel Winik      \nDaniel Winik \n \n \ncc:  All counsel (via CM/ECF)\n\nClearinghouse file: https://clearinghouse-umich-production.s3.amazonaws.com/media/doc/155244.pdf\nExternal link: https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69628289/01208709802/hampton-dellinger-v-scott-bessent/\nClearinghouse summary: clearinghouse.net/doc/155244"

Bessent, No. 25-5028 \n \nDear Mr. Cislak: \n \nIn the motion we filed this morning, we indicated (at 8 n.1) that we \nwould notify this Court when the district court acted on our pending \nstay motion.  The district court has denied that motion in the attached \norder.  Shortly thereafter, plaintiff filed his opposition, noting that the \nmotion was denied; we file this letter simply to ensure that the Court \nhas received the notice we indicated we would convey.  \nSincerely,  \n \n/s/ Daniel Winik      \nDaniel Winik \n \n \ncc:  All counsel (via CM/ECF) \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 19     Filed 02/13/25     Page 1 of 2\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n \n____________________________________ \n) \nHAMPTON DELLINGER  ) \nin his personal capacity and   ) \nin his official capacity as   ) \nSpecial Counsel of the   ) \nOffice of Special Counsel,  ) \n) \nPlaintiff,  ) \n)  Civil Action No. 25-0385 (ABJ) \nv.  )   \n) \nSCOTT BESSENT  ) \nin his official capacity as   ) \nSecretary of the Treasury, et al.,  ) \n) \nDefendants.  ) \n____________________________________) \n \nORDER \nOn Friday, February 7, 2025 at 7:21 p.m., plaintiff Dellinger was the Special Counsel in \nthe Office of Special Counsel, having been nominated by a President and confirmed by the Senate.  \nCompl. \u00b6 30.  That was the status quo.  At 7:22 p.m., the White House informed him that his \nposition was terminated without cause.  Ex. A to Compl. [Dkt. # 1-1]. \n \nThat action was contested.  In a lawsuit filed on Monday, February 10, plaintiff maintained \nthat it plainly violated an unambiguous provision of the United States Code that was enacted by \nCongress and signed into law by President George H.W. Bush:  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b).  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 \n20, 38\u201341.  And on that day, this Court entered an administrative stay to restore the status quo \nexisting before the contested action, that is, Dellinger\u2019s position as Special Counsel, for a very \nbrief period of time \u2013 until midnight on February 13 \u2013 so that it could receive the benefit of the \ndefendants\u2019 briefing before it ruled on plaintiff\u2019s pending motion seeking a temporary restraining \norder.  See Minute Order (Feb. 10, 2025).  Defendants appealed and moved for a stay of that \nunappealable order, but apparently, they did not comply with it.  See Defs.\u2019 Notice of the \nPresident\u2019s Designation of Acting Special Counsel [Dkt. # 13].  Their appeal has since been \ndismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  See Order, Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5025 (D.C. Cir. Feb. \n12, 2025).     \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 19     Filed 02/13/25     Page 2 of 2\nOn February 12 \u2013 ahead of its own schedule \u2013 the Court issued a temporary restraining \norder, again calling for the restoration of the duly appointed Special Counsel, i.e., the status quo, \nuntil it rules on the request for a preliminary injunction.  See Order [Dkt. # 14].  In the same order, \nthe Court set a prompt hearing date for the preliminary injunction, which is to be held on February \n26, 2025.  And again, defendants have moved for a stay while they appeal what is also an order of \nlimited duration that is not subject to appeal.  \n \nDefendants\u2019 position is that the statutory restrictions on the Special Counsel\u2019s removal are \nunconstitutional.  They are eager to have that issue heard and resolved by a higher court.  They \nwill have that opportunity in due course, but first, the issue has to be fully briefed in this Court, \nwhere the case is pending.  There has to be a hearing, and this Court has to issue an appealable \norder.  In the meantime, defendants must appreciate that moving for a stay is not the same thing \nas receiving a stay.  Indeed, as the Order issued on February 12 observes, the defendants have not \nidentified any harm to themselves or the public that could flow from the Special Counsel\u2019s \ncontinuing to perform his statutory duty to protect whistleblowers in the federal government on a \nnon-partisan basis.  Order at 25.   \n \nThe  Court  respects  the  importance  of  the  matter  and  the  Article  II  powers  and \nresponsibilities defendants are seeking to vindicate, and that is precisely why full briefing and a \nhearing are required.  It also respects the concerns underlying the very unique role the Office of \nSpecial Counsel was designed to play and the provisions Congress decided \u2013 after lengthy \nnegotiations with the executive branch \u2013 were necessary to enable the Special Counsel to fulfill \nthat role free of political interference.  His situation may not be found comparable to that of a \ntypical agency head who wields significant executive power to promulgate regulations or enforce \nthe law. \n \nThe Court has acted and will continue to act with extreme expedition.  It has alerted the \nparties to the fact that it is considering consolidation of the request for interim relief with \nconsideration of the merits, but it gave the parties the courtesy of expressing their views on that \nissue by tomorrow instead of doing so sua sponte.  \n \nFor all of these reasons, defendants\u2019 motion to stay the February 12, 2025 temporary \nrestraining order is DENIED. \n \n \nAMY BERMAN JACKSON \nUnited States District Judge \n \nDATE:  February 13, 2025 \n2\n\nClearinghouse file: https://clearinghouse-umich-production.s3.amazonaws.com/media/doc/155356.pdf\nExternal link: https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69636261/01208710696/hampton-dellinger-v-scott-bessent/\nClearinghouse summary: clearinghouse.net/doc/155356"

Yesterday evening, the Court \ndismissed the government\u2019s prior appeal from the district court\u2019s \u201cadminis-\ntrative stay\u201d ordering plaintiff\u2019s immediate reinstatement as Special Counsel \nand denied mandamus relief.  Judge Katsas filed a concurrence explaining \nthat it was \u201cunclear\u201d whether the \u201cserious but abstract separation-of-powers \nconcerns\u201d invoked by the government \u201cwould warrant treating an adminis-\ntrative stay or a [temporary restraining order (TRO)] as a preliminary injunc-\ntion,\u201d but finding that the three-day duration of the order in question \u201ccut[] \nstrongly against interlocutory review at this juncture.\u201d  Judge Katsas \u201cex-\npress[ed] no view on the appealability or merits of any later order granting \ninterim relief to Dellinger \u2026 , whether styled as a preliminary injunction or \nTRO.\u201d \nThe  government  respectfully  returns  to  this  Court  today  because, \nhours after this Court\u2019s decision, the district court last night issued a 27-page \nopinion granting a \u201ctemporary restraining order\u201d and restoring plaintiff to \noffice.  The court declared that plaintiff is likely to prevail on the merits and \n \n\nhas established the equitable prerequisites for relief.  Although the opinion \nfully addressed the issues raised in adversarial briefing\u2014indeed, the district \ncourt invited the parties to \u201cdeem the motion in support of the temporary \nrestraining order to be a memorandum in support of a motion for prelimi-\nnary injunction [or summary judgment], with the opposition and reply sim-\nilarly designated\u201d\u2014the court set the TRO to last for a full 14 days and spec-\nified that a hearing on \u201can appealable preliminary injunction\u201d or summary \njudgment would not be held until February 26.  Dkt. 14 at 27.  Thus, even if \nthe district court were to rule from the bench on the day of the scheduled \nhearing, the temporary relief the court has entered\u2014first styled as an \u201cad-\nministrative stay,\u201d now styled as a TRO\u2014will have lasted for 16 days.  And \nif the district court next extends the TRO to the 28-day maximum length per-\nmitted by Rule 65, to allow time for a ruling after the hearing, the court\u2019s \nincursion on the President\u2019s control over the Executive Branch could last for \nnearly a month.  \nThis \u201ctemporary restraining order\u201d is plainly an appealable injunction.  \nThe issues are entirely legal, the questions were fully briefed and resolved \nthrough adversarial presentation, and the district court issued a reasoned \n- 2 - \n\nopinion.  If not stayed, the court\u2019s \u201ctemporary restraining order\u201d could dis-\nplace the President\u2019s judgment about who should run an executive agency \nfor a meaningful portion of the President\u2019s first year in office.  For all the \nreasons articulated in the government\u2019s prior motion and rearticulated be-\nlow, a stay pending appeal (or, in the alternative, mandamus relief) is war-\nranted. \nGiven that the Court has already considered our prior motion and is \nfamiliar with the issues, the Acting Solicitor General respectfully requests a \nruling on this motion by Friday, February 14 at noon so that she has the \nopportunity to seek expeditious review from the Supreme Court if this Court \ndenies relief.  To facilitate a ruling on that timeline, the government waives \nany reply in support of this motion. \nSTATEMENT \nA.  Statutory Background \nCongress created the Office of the Special Counsel in the Civil Service \nReform Act of 1978.  Pub. L. No. 95-454, \u00a7 202(a), 92 Stat. 1111, 1122.  The Act \nauthorized the Special Counsel to receive and investigate \u201cany allegation of \na prohibited personnel practice,\u201d 92 Stat. at 1125, and to request corrective \naction from the Merit Systems Protection Board in cases where agency heads \n- 3 - \n\ndeclined to correct impermissible practices, id. at 1127, among other powers.  \nThe Act provided that the Special Counsel could \u201cbe removed by the Presi-\ndent only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d  Id. \nFrom the beginning, the Executive Branch objected to the constitution-\nality of that removal restriction.  In a published opinion, the Carter Admin-\nistration\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel explained that \u201c[b]ecause the Special \nCounsel [would] be performing largely executive functions, the Congress \n[could] not restrict the President\u2019s power to remove him.\u201d  Memorandum \nOpinion for the General Counsel, Civil Service Commission, 2 Op. O.L.C. 120, 122 \n(1978); see Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197, 221 (2020) (noting this \u201ccon-\ntemporaneous constitutional objection\u201d).  And when Congress passed an in-\nitial version of the Whistleblower Protection Act in 1988, separating OSC \nfrom the Merit Systems Protection Board and vesting OSC with additional \npowers, President Reagan pocket-vetoed the legislation, explaining that it \n\u201craised  serious  constitutional  concerns\u201d  by,  among  other  things,  \u201cpur-\nport[ing] to insulate the Office from presidential supervision and to limit the \npower of the President to remove his subordinates from office.\u201d  Public Pa-\npers of the Presidents, Ronald Reagan, Vol. II, Oct. 26, 1988, pp. 1391\u20131392 \n- 4 - \n\n(1991);  see  Seila  Law,  591  U.S.  at  221  (citing  this  \u201cveto  on  constitutional \ngrounds\u201d). \nCongress ultimately passed a revised version of the Whistleblower \nProtection Act that separated OSC from the Merit Systems Protection Board \nwhile removing certain of the additional powers that the initial version \nwould have granted the Office.  Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, Pub. \nL. No. 101-12, 103 Stat. 16.  President George H.W. Bush signed that bill, not-\nwithstanding its maintenance of the restrictions on removal of the Special \nCounsel.  But the Executive Branch did not recede from its constitutional \nobjection to Congress\u2019s placement of restrictions on the removal of agency \nheads.  In 1994, for example, the Office of Legal Counsel advised President \nClinton \u201cthat the [Social Security Administration]\u2019s new structure as an \nagency led by a single person with tenure protection was \u2018extraordinary\u2019\u201d \nand that the tenure protection presented a \u201c\u2018serious constitutional question\u2019\u201d \nbecause it \u201c\u2018would severely erode the President\u2019s authority.\u2019\u201d  Constitution-\nality of the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s Tenure Protection, 45 Op. O.L.C. __, \n2021 WL 2981542, at *2 (O.L.C. July 8, 2021) (quoting Letter for Lloyd N. Cut-\nler, Counsel to the President, from Walter Dellinger, Assistant Attorney Gen-\neral, Office of Legal Counsel (July 29, 1994)). \n- 5 - \n\nToday, OSC exercises essentially the same powers as it originally pos-\nsessed.  The Special Counsel is vested with an array of executive powers and \nfunctions.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1212.  The Special Counsel\u2019s responsibilities include \ninvestigating  allegations  of  prohibited  personnel  practices,  5  U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1214(a)(1)(A), and initiating disciplinary actions through the filing of com-\nplaints before the Merit Systems Protection Board, see id. \u00a7 1215(a)(1). \nB.  This Litigation \nHampton Dellinger was appointed by President Biden and confirmed \nby the Senate to serve as Special Counsel, beginning in March 2024.  Dkt. 1 \n\u00b6 1.  On February 7, 2025, the Director of the White House Presidential Per-\nsonnel Office informed Dellinger that the President had removed him from \noffice effective immediately.  Id. \u00b6 2. \nOn Monday, February 10, Dellinger brought this suit to challenge his \nremoval, Dkt. 1, and moved for a temporary restraining order, Dkt. 2.  Upon \nreceiving the motion, the district court set a near-immediate hearing, before \nthe government had responded to the motion for a temporary restraining \norder.  Several hours later, the court entered what it described as \u201ca brief \nadministrative stay\u201d restoring Dellinger to the office of Special Counsel, rea-\nsoning that the stay was necessary \u201cto preserve the status quo.\u201d   \n- 6 - \n\nThe government filed a notice of appeal and a motion for an emer-\ngency stay or, in the alternative, mandamus.  On February 12, this Court dis-\nmissed the government\u2019s appeal, denied mandamus relief, and dismissed \nthe stay motion as moot.  Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5025 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 12, \n2025).  The Court\u2019s order issued at approximately 6:30 pm.  Two hours later, \nthe district court issued a 27-page opinion granting a temporary restraining \norder, parsing the parties\u2019 arguments in detail, concluding that plaintiff is \nlikely to succeed on the merits in this litigation, and finding that the balance \nof equities favored restoring plaintiff to office notwithstanding his removal \nby the President.   \nARGUMENT \nIn  considering  a  stay  pending  appeal,  this  Court  examines \n\u201c\u2018(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely \nto succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured \nabsent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the \n- 7 - \n\nother parties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest \nlies.\u2019\u201d  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 426 (2009).1 \nA.  This Court Has Jurisdiction. \nThis Court has jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s order.  Alt-\nhough TROs are ordinarily not appealable, they are appealable where they \nare \u201cmore akin to preliminary injunctive relief.\u201d  Garza v. Hargan, 2017 WL \n9854552, at *1 n.1 (D.C. Cir. Oct. 20, 2017), vacated in part on reh\u2019g en banc, 874 \nF.3d 735 (D.C. Cir. 2017), vacated sub nom. Azar v. Garza, 584 U.S. 726 (2018); \nsee Belbacha v. Bush, 520 F.3d 452, 455 (D.C. Cir. 2008) (treating denial of tem-\nporary restraining order as \u201c\u2018tantamount to denial of a preliminary injunc-\ntion\u2019\u201d).  That is true here for two reasons. \nFirst, as our prior motion explained, the order works an extraordinary \nharm to the President\u2019s authority over the Executive Branch by reinstating \nthe principal officer of a single-headed agency after the President\u2019s removal \nof the officer.  This Court has identified the significance of the harm that a \nTRO poses to the Executive Branch as a relevant factor in determining the \n \n1 The government last night filed a stay motion in district court pursu-\nant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 8(a).  We will notify the Court \nwhen the district court acts on that motion. \n- 8 - \n\nappealability of the TRO.  See Adams v. Vance, 570 F.2d 950, 953 (D.C. Cir. \n1978) (allowing appeal of a TRO that \u201ccommanded an unprecedented action \nirreversibly altering the delicate diplomatic balance in the environmental \narena\u201d). \nSecond, the district court has now considerably prolonged that harm \nby setting its TRO to last for 14 days, on top of the two-day duration of its \n\u201cadministrative stay\u201d (which, as discussed in our prior motion\u2014and as \nplaintiff conceded in opposing that motion, see No. 25-5025 Opp. 11, 13\u2014\nwas itself effectively a TRO).  It has done so even though the issues have \nbeen adversarially presented in briefs sufficiently comprehensive that the \ndistrict court expressly invited the parties to deem them to be preliminary-\ninjunction or summary-judgment papers.  Dkt. 14 at 27.  It has done so with-\nout offering any explanation of why a 14-day delay before a hearing is ap-\npropriate\u2014particularly when the initial hearing, held prior to the entry of \nthe administrative stay, was held in a matter of hours.  And its order sug-\ngests that appeal is unavailable until after whatever ruling follows the Feb-\nruary 26 hearing.  See id. (referring to \u201can appealable preliminary injunc-\ntion\u201d).  As our prior motion noted, the Supreme Court has stressed that a \n- 9 - \n\ndistrict court cannot \u201cshield its orders from appellate review merely by des-\nignating them as temporary restraining orders, rather than as preliminary \ninjunctions.\u201d  Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 86-87 (1974). \nIn any event, even if this Court were to conclude that the order is un-\nappealable, the Court should exercise its discretion to treat this motion as a \npetition for writ of mandamus.  Ukiah Adventist Hosp. v. FTC, 981 F.2d 543, \n548 n.6 (D.C. Cir. 1992).  The district court\u2019s extraordinary order readily sat-\nisfies the standard to grant mandamus.  See Cheney v. U.S. Dist. Court for D.C., \n542 U.S. 367, 380-381 (2004).  First, if the district court\u2019s order is not appeala-\nble, then there is \u201c\u2018no other adequate means,\u2019\u201d id. at 380-381, for the govern-\nment to vindicate the President\u2019s authority under Article II to exercise the \nentire Executive power of the United States.  Second, given the Supreme \nCourt\u2019s recent decisions in Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (2021), and Seila Law, \nthe government\u2019s \u201cright to issuance of the writ is clear and indisputable,\u201d \nCheney, 542 U.S. at 381 (quotation marks omitted).  And finally, the issuance \nof the writ \u201cis appropriate,\u201d id.\u2014indeed, it is necessary\u2014to protect our con-\nstitutional structure by safeguarding the President\u2019s prerogative against in-\ntrusion by the Judicial Branch. \n- 10 - \n\nB.  The Government Is Likely To Prevail On The Merits. \nOSC is an Executive Branch agency \u201cheaded by a single officer,\u201d Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 221.  As described above, from the time OSC was first created \nin 1978, and across several administrations in the years since, the Executive \nBranch has expressed doubt as to whether Congress may preclude the Pres-\nident from removing the Special Counsel at will.  Over the past five years, \nSupreme Court precedent has definitively resolved that question in the neg-\native.  Officials vested with sole responsibility for overseeing the exercise of \nexecutive power must be directly answerable to the President.   \n1.  At-will removal is the general rule, and OSC does \nnot fit within any exceptions. \nArticle II of the Constitution provides that \u201cthe \u2018executive Power\u2019\u2014all \nof it\u2014is \u2018vested in a President,\u2019 who must \u2018take Care that the Laws be faith-\nfully executed.\u2019\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 203 (quoting U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 1, cl. \n1; id. \u00a7 3).  To discharge those responsibilities, the President \u201cas a general \nmatter\u201d has \u201cauthority to remove those who assist him in carrying out his \nduties.\u201d  Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Accounting Oversight Board, 561 U.S. \n477, 513-514 (2010).  \u201cWithout such power, the President could not be held \nfully accountable for discharging his own responsibilities; the buck would \n- 11 - \n\nstop somewhere else.\u201d  Id. at 514; see also, e.g., Exela Enter. Sols., Inc. v. NLRB, \n32 F.4th 436, 445 (5th Cir. 2022) (\u201cThe President's power to remove is essen-\ntial to the performance of his Article II responsibilities and control over the \nExecutive Branch.\u201d).  \nThe Supreme Court has \u201crecognized only two exceptions to the Presi-\ndent\u2019s unrestricted removal power.\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 203.  First, in \nHumphrey\u2019s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), the Court held that \nCongress could \u201cgive for-cause removal protections to a multimember body \nof experts, balanced along partisan lines, that performed legislative and ju-\ndicial functions and was said not to exercise any executive power.\u201d  Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 216.  Second, the Court has held that \u201cCongress could pro-\nvide tenure protections to certain inferior officers with narrowly defined du-\nties.\u201d  Id. at 204 (citing Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988), and United States \nv. Perkins, 116 U.S. 483 (1886)). \nThe Special Counsel does not fit within either of these exceptions.  He \nis not an inferior officer with narrowly defined duties; he is a principal of-\nficer appointed by the President with Senate confirmation, see U.S. Const. \nart. II, \u00a7 2, cl. 2; 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b), who oversees his own Department and is \nnot subservient to any other principal officer, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1211-1212.  See \n- 12 - \n\nalso Free Enterprise Fund, 561 U.S. at 511 (explaining that a Department \u201cis a \nfreestanding component of the Executive Branch, not subordinate to or con-\ntained within any other such component\u201d).  Nor does the Special Counsel \nwork as part of a \u201cmultimember expert agency,\u201d Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 218; \nhe serves as the sole head of his agency, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(a).   \nThe district court acknowledged that the Special Counsel \u201cis not en-\ntirely analogous\u201d to either the Federal Trade Commission in the form ap-\nproved in Humphrey\u2019s Executor or the Independent Counsel approved in \nMorrison.  Dkt. 14 at 12.  The court\u2019s analysis should have stopped there.  As \nthe Supreme Court has explained, those are the \u201conly two exceptions to the \nPresident's unrestricted removal power\u201d and those exceptions should not be \nextended to \u201cnovel context[s].\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 204. \n2.  Heads  of  single-member  Executive  departments \nmust be removable at will by the President. \nFive years ago, the Supreme Court surveyed the Executive Branch and \nidentified  only  four  then-existing  examples  of  single-member  agencies \nwhose heads were afforded protection against at-will removal.  See Seila Law, \n591 U.S. at 290-292.  As described below, the Supreme Court has now itself \ninvalidated the removal protections for two of these agencies (the CFPB and \n- 13 - \n\nthe FHFA).  The Office of Legal Counsel and two courts of appeals have con-\ncluded that the removal protections for a third (the Social Security Admin-\nistration) are likewise invalid.  The Office of Special Counsel is the fourth.    \nIn Seila Law, the Supreme Court invalidated the removal restrictions \nfor the Director of the CFPB, explaining that the \u201csingle-Director structure \ncontravenes\u201d the Constitution\u2019s \u201ccarefully calibrated system by vesting sig-\nnificant governmental power in the hands of a single individual accountable \nto no one.\u201d  591 U.S. at 224.  When the Founders chose to vest executive au-\nthority in a single person, the Court explained, they ensured that the Presi-\ndent would be \u201cthe most democratic and politically accountable official in \nGovernment \u2026 elected by the entire Nation.\u201d  Id.  Thus, while executive of-\nficers assist the President in carrying out his responsibilities, they \u201cremain[] \nsubject to the ongoing supervision and control of the elected President.\u201d  Id.  \nBy contrast, the CFPB Director could \u201cunilaterally, without meaningful su-\npervision, issue final regulations, oversee adjudications, set enforcement pri-\norities, initiate prosecutions, and determine what penalties to impose,\u201d id. at \n225, while the President was constrained to permit the Director to do so ab-\nsent  \u201cinefficiency,  neglect  of  duty,  or  malfeasance  in  office,\u201d  12  U.S.C. \n\u00a7 5491(c)(3).  The Court held that restriction unconstitutional, concluding \n- 14 - \n\nthat \u201cprincipal officers who, acting alone, wield significant executive power\u201d \nmust be removable at will by the President.  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 238.  \nThe Supreme Court applied the same logic when it invalidated the \u201cfor \ncause\u201d removal restriction for the Director of the FHFA.  Collins, 594 U.S. at \n226-228.  The Court explained that Seila Law was \u201call but dispositive,\u201d as the \nFHFA was \u201can agency led by a single Director\u201d for whom Congress had \u201cre-\nstrict[ed] the President\u2019s removal power.\u201d  Id. at 250-251.  In doing so, the \nCourt rejected an argument that the FHFA should be treated differently be-\ncause it did not exercise as much executive authority as the CFPB did.  Id. at \n251.  \u201c[T]he nature and breadth of an agency\u2019s authority is not dispositive,\u201d \nthe Court explained, \u201cin determining whether Congress may limit the Pres-\nident\u2019s power to remove its head.\u201d  Id. at 251-252.  The key purpose of the \nremoval power is to ensure that \u201cExecutive Branch actions\u201d are subject \u201cto a \ndegree  of  electoral  accountability,\u201d  which  is  \u201cimplicated  whenever  an \nagency does important work.\u201d  Id. at 252.  Collins thus declined to carve out \nan exception to the general rule of at-will removal based on \u201cthe relative \nimportance of the regulatory and enforcement authority of disparate agen-\ncies.\u201d  Id. at 253. \n- 15 - \n\nIn the wake of Seila Law and Collins, President Biden removed the \nCommissioner of Social Security without cause, contrary to the statutory \nlimitations that restricted removal of that agency head except for \u201cneglect of \nduty or malfeasance in office.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(a)(3).  In supporting the le-\ngality of that decision, the Department of Justice explained that \u201cthe best \nreading of Collins and Seila Law\u201d led to the conclusion that \u201cthe President \nneed not heed the Commissioner\u2019s statutory tenure protection.\u201d  Constitu-\ntionality of the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s Tenure Protection, 2021 WL \n2981542, at *1, 7.  The only courts of appeals to have considered the ques-\ntion\u2014the Ninth and Eleventh Circuits\u2014have both concluded that the re-\nmoval restrictions for the single-headed Social Security Administration are \nunconstitutional.  Rodriguez v. SSA, 118 F.4th 1302, 1313-1314 (11th Cir. 2024); \nKaufmann v. Kijakazi, 32 F.4th 843, 848-849 (9th Cir. 2022). \nOSC is indistinguishable from the other single-headed agencies iden-\ntified in Seila Law.  In his concurrence to the dismissal of the government\u2019s \nprior appeal in this case, Judge Katsas observed that \u201cit would be difficult \nfor Dellinger to show a likelihood of success in light of\u201d Collins and Seila Law, \n- 16 - \n\n\u201cwhich held that Article II of the Constitution prevents Congress from re-\nstricting the President\u2019s ability to remove officers who serve as the sole heads \nof agencies that wield significant executive power.\u201d   \nThere can be no serious dispute that the Special Counsel exercises ex-\necutive authority:  He may \u201cinvestigate allegations of prohibited personnel \npractices,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1212(a)(2); \u201cbring actions concerning allegations of vi-\nolations of other laws within the jurisdiction of\u201d his office, id. \u00a7 1212(a)(4); \nissue subpoenas, id. \u00a7 1212(b)(2)(A); intervene in other proceedings before \nthe  Merit  Systems  Protection  Board,  id.  \u00a7 1212(c)(1);  appoint  others,  id. \n\u00a7 1212(d)(1); prescribe regulations, id. \u00a7 1212(e); appear in federal court as an \namicus curiae, id. \u00a7 1212(h)(1); and bring disciplinary actions against federal \nemployees, id. \u00a7 1215(a)(1).  These are core executive functions.      \nThe exercise of those duties clearly implicates the faithful execution of \nfederal law.  When Congress first created OSC in 1978, the Carter Admin-\nistration objected and explained that \u201cCongress may not properly limit the \ngrounds for removal of the Special Counsel by the President,\u201d because the \nSpecial Counsel \u201cmust be removable at will.\u201d  Memorandum Opinion for the \nGeneral Counsel, Civil Service Commission, 2 Op. O.L.C. at 120.  That is because \n\u201cthe Special Counsel\u2019s functions are executive in character,\u201d and his \u201crole in \n- 17 - \n\ninvestigating and prosecuting prohibited practices is much the same as that \nof a U.S. Attorney or other Federal prosecutors,\u201d which \u201care directed at the \nenforcement of the laws.\u201d  Id.  Even at that time, before Seila Law and Collins, \nit was clear that Humphrey\u2019s Executor did \u201cnot extend to an officer appointed \nby the President with the advice and consent of the Senate, who performs \npredominantly  executive  functions  and  who,  by  reason  of  the  statutory \nscheme, is independent of the quasi-judicial process.\u201d  Id. at 122.  And Pres-\nident Reagan reiterated those \u201cserious constitutional concerns\u201d about the \nSpecial Counsel\u2019s insulation from electoral accountability.  See Public Papers \nof the Presidents, Ronald Reagan, Vol. II, Oct. 26, 1988, pp. 1391\u20131392 (1991).   \n3.    The  district  court\u2019s  contrary  reasoning  does  not \nwithstand scrutiny.   \nThe district court analogized the Special Counsel to the Independent \nCounsel whose removal protections were sustained in Morrison.  Dkt. 14 at \n11.  But Morrison concerned a removal-protected inferior officer, not the head \nof a freestanding component within the executive branch.  Indeed, as the \ndistrict court acknowledged, plaintiff \u201cdoes not argue here \u2026 that the Spe-\ncial Counsel is an \u2018inferior officer.\u2019\u201d  Id.  Because the concerns implicated by \na removal-protected principal officer, who has no superior other than the \n- 18 - \n\nPresident, are different from those applicable to inferior officers, Morrison is \ninapposite.   \nThe district court also mistakenly claimed support for its conclusion in \nthe fact that Collins did \u201cnot comment on the constitutionality of any removal \nrestriction that applies to\u201d the Special Counsel, among other officers not then \nbefore the Court.  Dkt. 14 at 14 (quoting Collins, 594 U.S. at 256 n.21).  The \nSupreme Court\u2019s care in not reaching questions not directly before it in Col-\nlins provides no meaningful basis for distinguishing the Special Counsel \nfrom the office addressed in Collins, just as Seila Law\u2019s analysis of a different \noffice was \u201call but dispositive\u201d in Collins itself.  Collins, 594 U.S. at 250, 256 \nn.21.   \nThe district court also minimized the significance of the executive au-\nthority wielded by the Special Counsel, contrasting it against that of the \nCFPB and the FHFA.  But Collins explained that \u201c[c]ourts are not well-suited \nto weigh the relative importance of the regulatory and enforcement author-\nity  of  disparate  agencies\u201d  and  that  \u201cthe  constitutionality  of  removal  re-\nstrictions\u201d does not \u201chinge[] on such an inquiry.\u201d  594 U.S. at 253.  As noted \nabove, the Special Counsel exercises meaningful prosecutorial and regula-\ntory authority, including through the initiation of proceedings before the \n- 19 - \n\nMerit Systems Protection Board.  See generally 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1212; see also, e.g., \nRieth-Riley Constr. Co. v. NLRB, 114 F.4th 519, 531 (6th Cir. 2024) (recognizing \nin the context of the NLRB General Counsel that \u201c[t]he authority to initiate \nor dismiss complaints is a purely executive, not judicial, function\u201d and \u201cis \nsquarely on the prosecutorial side of the \u2018prosecutorial versus adjudicatory \nline\u2019\u201d).  That is sufficient to place OSC within the rule established in Seila Law \nand Collins.     \nThe district court also deemed it significant that Presidents Carter and \nGeorge H.W. Bush signed the two pieces of legislation that give OSC its cur-\nrent structure.  Dkt. 14 at 13 n.3.  But \u201cit is not uncommon for Presidents to \napprove legislation containing parts which are objectionable on constitu-\ntional grounds.\u201d  INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 942 n.13 (1983).  And the Su-\npreme  Court  in  Seila  Law  expressly  noted  the  Justice  Department\u2019s \nlongstanding objections in explaining that there was no historical pedigree \nfor single-member agency heads with removal protections.  591 U.S. at 221. \nThe district court also noted that Office of Legal Counsel opinion con-\ncerning the Commissioner of Social Security stated that it was not opining \non \u201cthe validity of tenure protections conferred on other executive officials\u2014\n- 20 - \n\nfor example the Special Counsel\u201d\u2014and identified two ways in which it be-\nlieved the Special Counsel differed from the Commissioner of Social Security \n(namely the Special Counsel\u2019s primarily investigatory function and \u201climited \njurisdiction\u201d).  Op. 15 n.4; see Constitutionality of the Commissioner of Social \nSecurity\u2019s Tenure Protection, 2021 WL 2981542, at *9.  But the Office did not \ndisavow, or even mention, its prior determination that \u201c[b]ecause the Special \nCounsel [would] be performing largely executive functions, the Congress \n[could] not restrict the President\u2019s power to remove him,\u201d 2 Op. O.L.C. at \n122.  The 2021 opinion does not undercut the applicability of Seila Law here.   \n4.  Plaintiff cannot show entitlement to reinstatement.  \nThe district court also did not meaningfully grapple with the grave \nseparation-of-powers issues posed by a judicial order reinstating a principal \nofficer who has been removed by the President.   Neither plaintiff nor the \ndistrict court has cited any decision from this Court or the Supreme Court \nsuggesting such a remedy would be appropriate.  When principal officers \nhave been removed from their posts, they generally have challenged that \nremoval in suits for back pay.  See Humphrey\u2019s Executor, 295 U.S. at 612 (chal-\nlenge sought \u201cto recover a sum of money alleged to be due\u201d); Myers v. United \nStates, 272 U.S. 52, 106 (1926) (same); Wiener v. United States, 357 U.S. 349, \n- 21 - \n\n349-351 (1958) (same).  The President cannot be compelled to retain the ser-\nvices of a principal officer whom the President no longer believes should be \nentrusted with the exercise of executive power.  Such a remedy would un-\ndermine the objective of electoral accountability within the Executive Branch \nthat animated the holdings in Seila Law and Collins. \nC.  The Equitable Factors Favor A Stay. \nFinally, the equitable factors likewise weigh decisively in the govern-\nment\u2019s favor, and \u201cthe public interest and balance of equities factors merge\u201d \nwhere, as here, \u201cthe government is the party\u201d against whom an injunction is \nsought, MediNatura, Inc. v. FDA, 998 F.3d 931, 945 (D.C. Cir. 2021). \n1.  As discussed above, the district court\u2019s order works an extraor-\ndinary harm to the President\u2019s authority to exercise \u201call of\u201d \u201cthe \u2018executive \nPower\u2019\u201d of the United States, Seila Law, 590 U.S. at 203.  Because of that order, \na person the President has chosen to remove from office is exercising execu-\ntive power over the President\u2019s objection.  That sort of harm to the Executive, \nand to the constitutional separation of powers, is transparently irreparable. \nIn its TRO ruling, the district court asserted that the government had \nfailed to identify \u201ccircumstances that required the President\u2019s hasty, unex-\nplained action or that would justify the immediate ejection of the Senate-\n- 22 - \n\nconfirmed Special Counsel while the legal is subject to calm and thorough \ndeliberation.\u201d  Dkt. 14 at 25.  But that language only underscores the threat \nthe TRO poses to the President\u2019s authority under Article II.  The President \ndoes not need to persuade federal courts of the wisdom or deliberateness of \nhis exercise of core authorities, such as the designation or removal of agency \nheads, before his actions are permitted to take effect.  There is nothing wrong \nwith \u201ccalm and thorough\u201d review by a district court, id., but enjoining the \nPresident\u2019s exercise of his authority while that review takes place is another \nmatter. \n2.  Conversely, a stay is not necessary to prevent any cognizable \nharm to plaintiff.  As Judge Katsas wrote in his concurrence to the dismissal \nof the government\u2019s prior appeal, \u201cit would be difficult for Dellinger to show \nirreparable injury during whatever modest amount of time may be neces-\nsary to adjudicate an expedited motion for preliminary injunction, either to \nhimself or to an agency that would otherwise have a presidentially desig-\nnated acting head.\u201d \nThe district court reasoned that \u201cplaintiff was appointed for a fixed \nterm, and he has a statutory mission that his removal has rendered him un-\nable to fulfill: to \u2018protect employees, former employees, and applicants for \n- 23 - \n\nemployment from prohibited personnel practices.\u2019\u201d  Dkt. 14 at 20.  But the \nfulfillment of that mission is an obligation of the agency, not of plaintiff in \nhis personal capacity.  It is the President to whom the Constitution assigns \nthe prerogative to determine who should lead the agency in fulfilling that \nmission.  And plaintiff\u2019s \u201cfixed term\u201d in office poses no separate obstacle to \nhis removal, as this Court has recognized.  See Severino v. Biden, 71 F. 4th \n1038, 1047 (D.C. Cir. 2023).  Any cognizable harm to plaintiff here, should \nhis removal ultimately be held to have been unlawful, could be remedied by \nan award of back pay. \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should stay the district court\u2019s order pending appeal.  To \nthe extent the Court harbors any doubt about its appellate jurisdiction, it \nshould treat this appeal as a petition for a writ of mandamus and grant a \nwrit directing the district court to vacate its order.  The Acting Solicitor Gen-\n- 24 - \n\neral respectfully requests that the Court rule on this motion by Friday, Feb-\nruary 14 at noon so that she has the opportunity to seek expeditious review \nfrom the Supreme Court if this Court denies relief.   \nRespectfully submitted, \n  BRETT A.

Statutory Background  \n  The Office of Special Counsel is an independent agency originally created by the Civil \nService Reform Act of 1978 (\u201cCSRA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1206 et seq., to \u201csafeguard\u201d federal civil service \nemployees \u201cwho \u2018blow the whistle\u2019 on illegal or improper official conduct.\u201d  See Wren v. Merit \nSystems Protection Bd., 681 F.2d 867, 872\u201383 (D.C. Cir. 1982).  The OSC was first established as \na part of the Merit Systems Protection Board (\u201cMSPB\u201d), but in 1989, Congress separated the OSC \nas an independent agency in the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101\u201312, 103 \nStat. 16 (Apr. 10, 1989).       \n  The statute that spells out the powers and functions of the Office of the Special Counsel \nstates  that  OSC  \u201cshall  protect  [federal]  employees,  former  employees,  and  applicants  for \nemployment from prohibited personnel practices.\u201d  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1212(a)(1).  To fulfill this mandate, \nOSC is authorized to \u201creceive and investigate allegations of prohibited personnel practices,\u201d and \n\u201cwhere appropriate, bring petitions for stays and petitions for corrective action.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1212(a)(2).   \n  The statute enables the agency to operate in three primary ways.  First, under section 1213, \nthe agency acts as a confidential channel for a federal employee to disclose \u201cinformation\u201d that the \nindividual \u201creasonably believes evidences\u201d:  (1) \u201ca violation of any law, rule, or regulation\u201d;  (2) \n\u201cgross mismanagement\u201d;  (3) \u201ca gross waste of funds\u201d;  (4) \u201can abuse of authority\u201d; or (5) a \n\u201csubstantial and specific danger to public health or safety.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1213(a)(1)(A), (B).  The \u201cidentity \nof any individual who makes a disclosure . . . may not be disclosed by the Special Counsel, with \ncertain narrow exceptions.  Id. \u00a7 1213(h).  If the Special Counsel determines that there is a \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/12/25     Page 4 of 27\n\u201csubstantial likelihood\u201d that the information discloses a violation of law, or other enumerated \nwrongdoing, the Special Counsel asks the relevant agency to investigate and report on the matter.  \nId. \u00a7 1213(c).  The OSC then reviews the agency\u2019s report, gives the whistleblower an opportunity \nto comment, creates its own assessment of the report, and submits both the agency report and the \nOSC\u2019s findings to Congress and the President.  Id. \u00a7 1213(e).  In these types of disclosure cases, \nthe OSC does not have independent authority to investigate.  See generally id. \u00a7 1213. \nSecond, the agency can \u201creceive\u201d and \u201cinvestigate\u201d allegations of prohibited personnel \npractices,  including  whistleblower  and  other  types  of  discrimination  or  retaliation.    Id.  \u00a7 \n1212(a)(2);  id. \u00a7 2302(b)(1)\u2013(14) (defining \u201cprohibited personal practice\u201d).  In furtherance of this \nduty, the OSC may \u201cissue subpoenas\u201d and order \u201cthe taking of depositions\u201d and \u201cresponses to \nwritten interrogatories.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1212(b)(2)(A), (B).   \nIf the OSC determines \u201cthat there are reasonable grounds to believe\u201d that a prohibited \npractice has occurred, exists, or will occur, it can work with the relevant agency to ensure that is \ncorrective action is taken.  See id. \u00a7 1214(b)(2).  But, \u201c[i]f, after a reasonable period of time, the \nagency does not act to correct the prohibited personnel practice,\u201d OSC may petition the Merits \nSystem Review Board for corrective action. Id. \u00a7 1214(b)(2)(C); id. \u00a7 1212(a)(2)(A).  The OSC \nhas no authority over the MSPB, which is itself an independent adjudicatory agency.  See id. \u00a7 \n1202.   \nSimilarly, the OSC has authority under the Hatch Act, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7321 et seq., to \ninvestigate \u201cany allegation\u201d concerning prohibited \u201cpolitical activity\u201d and \u201cany activity relating to \npolitical intrusion in personnel decisionmaking.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1216(a)(1), (4).  If the Special Counsel \ndetermines \u201cthat disciplinary action should be taken,\u201d the Special Counsel must \u201cprepare a written \ncomplaint against the employee\u201d to present to the MSPB, which ultimately adjudicates the matter \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/12/25     Page 5 of 27\nand determines whether disciplinary measures are appropriate.  Id. \u00a7 1215.  The OSC also has \nauthority to investigate and enforce claims under the Uniformed Services Employment and \nReemployment Rights Act (\u201cUSERRA\u201d), 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4301\u201335, which prohibits employment \ndiscrimination against members of the uniformed services and veterans \u201cbecause of their service \nin the uniformed services.\u201d  38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4301(a)(3), 4311.  The agency can further \u201creview rules \nand regulations issued by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management\u201d and can \u201cfile a \nwritten complaint\u201d with the MSPB if it \u201cfinds that any such rule or regulation would, on its face \nor  as  implemented,  require  the  commission  of  a  prohibited  personnel  practice.\u201d    5  U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1212(a)(4).     \n  Third, the OSC has reporting obligations to Congress.  The Special Counsel must submit a \nreport to Congress \u201c[o]n an annual basis\u201d regarding the \u201cactivities\u201d of the agency, which must \ninclude, among other things, \u201cthe number, types, and disposition of allegations of prohibited \npersonnel practices filed with the Special Counsel and the costs of resolving such allegations.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 1218(1)\u2013(13).  And each time the OSC resolves an allegation \u201cby an agreement between any \nagency and an individual,\u201d it must submit a report to Congress \u201cregarding the agreement.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 1217(b)(1).  Further, \u201con the request of any committee or subcommittee,\u201d the Special Counsel \nor his designee \u201cshall transmit to the Congress . . . by report, testimony, or otherwise, information \nand the Special Counsel\u2019s views on functions, responsibilities, or other matters relating to the \nOffice.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1217(a).  That information is also \u201ctransmitted concurrently to the President and \nany other appropriate agency in the executive branch.\u201d  Id.   \n  The Office of the Special Counsel is led by the Special Counsel, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(a), who \nis \u201cappointed by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate\u201d to serve \u201cfor a \nterm of five years.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1211(b).  Congress requires that the Special Counsel must \u201cbe an attorney \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/12/25     Page 6 of 27\nwho, by demonstrated ability, background, training, or experience, is especially qualified to carry \nout the functions of the position.\u201d  Id.  And, by statute, \u201c[t]he Special Counsel may be removed by \nthe President only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d  Id.    \nB.  Factual Background \nOn October 3, 2023, President Biden nominated Hampton Dellinger to be Special Counsel.  \nCompl. \u00b6 30.  The Senate confirmed Dellinger on February 27, 2024, and he was sworn into office \non March 6, 2024.  Compl. \u00b6 30.  His five-year term will expire in 2029.

Legal Standard \n\u201cA temporary restraining order is an extraordinary remedy, one that should be granted only \nwhen  the  moving  party,  by  a  clear  showing,  carries  the  burden  of  persuasion.\u201d  Sibley  v. \nObama, 810 F. Supp. 2d 309, 310 (D.D.C. 2011), citing Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 972, \n(1997); Munaf v. Geren, 553 U.S. 674, 690\u201391 (2008).   \n   As the Supreme Court explained in Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 \n(2008), when considering a motion for a preliminary injunction, the Court must consider whether \nthe movant has met its burden of demonstrating that:  1) it \u201cis likely to succeed on the merits\u201d;  2) \nit is \u201clikely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief\u201d;  3) \u201cthe balance of \nequities tips in [its] favor\u201d; and 4) an injunction serves the public interest.  Id.  \u201cThe court considers \nthe same factors in ruling on a motion for a temporary restraining order.\u201d  Morgan Stanley DW \nInc. v. Rothe, 150 F. Supp. 2d 67, 72 (D.D.C. 2001). \n  The manner in which courts should weigh the four factors \u201cremains an open question\u201d in \nthis Circuit.  Aamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d 1023, 1043 (D.C. Cir. 2014).  For some time, the Court \nof Appeals adhered to the \u201csliding-scale\u201d approach, where \u201ca strong showing on one factor could \nmake up for a weaker showing on another.\u201d  Sherley v. Sebelius, 644 F.3d 388, 392 (D.C. Cir. \n2011) (citations omitted).  However, the Sherley opinion explains that because the Supreme \nCourt\u2019s  decision  in  Winter \u201cseemed  to  treat  the  four  factors  as  independent  requirements,\u201d \nthe Court of Appeals has more recently \u201cread Winter at least to suggest if not to hold \u2018that a \nlikelihood of success is an independent, free-standing requirement for a preliminary injunction.\u2019\u201d  \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/12/25     Page 8 of 27\nId. at 393, quoting Davis v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., 571 F.3d 1288, 1296 (D.C. Cir. 2009) \n(Kavanaugh, J., concurring).  The Court will follow this approach.  \nAlthough the D.C. Circuit has not yet announced \u201cwhether the \u2018sliding scale\u2019 approach \nremains valid after Winter,\u201d League of Women Voters v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 7 (D.C. Cir. 2016), it \nhas ruled that a failure to show a likelihood of success on the merits is sufficient to defeat a motion \nfor a preliminary injunction.  See Ark. Dairy Coop. Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Agric., 573 F.3d \n815, 832 (D.C. Cir. 2009); Apotex, Inc. v. FDA, 449 F.3d 1249, 1253\u201354 (D.C. Cir. 2006). As \nanother court in this district has observed, \u201cabsent a substantial indication of likely success on the \nmerits, there would be no justification for the Court\u2019s intrusion into the ordinary processes of \nadministration and judicial review.\u201d Navistar, Inc. v. EPA, Civil Action No. 11-cv-449 (RLW), \n2011 WL 3743732, at *3 (D.D.C. Aug. 25, 2011) (alteration omitted), quoting Hubbard v. United \nStates, 496 F. Supp. 2d 194, 198 (D.D.C. 2007). \nRegardless of whether the sliding scale framework applies, it remains the law in this \nCircuit that a movant must demonstrate irreparable harm, which has \u201calways\u201d been a \u201cbasis of \ninjunctive  relief  in  the  federal  courts.\u201d   Sampson  v.  Murray,  415  U.S.  61,  88  (1974), \nquoting Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500, 506\u201307 (1959).  A failure to show \nirreparable harm is grounds for the Court to refuse to issue an injunction, \u201ceven if the other three \nfactors entering the calculus merit such relief.\u201d  Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, \n454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006).   \nII.  The likelihood of success on the merits. \nThe Court finds that there is a substantial likelihood that plaintiff will succeed on the merits. \nThe effort by the White House to terminate the Special Counsel without identifying any cause \nplainly contravenes the statute, which states, \u201c[t]he Special Counsel may be removed by the \n8 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/12/25     Page 9 of 27\nPresident only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b).  \nThis language expresses Congress\u2019s clear intent to ensure the independence of the Special Counsel \nand insulate his work from being buffeted by the winds of political change.    \nDefendants\u2019 only response to this inarguable reading of the text is that the statute is \nunconstitutional.  Defs.\u2019 Opp. at 8\u201311.  But no court has said so, and to date, the Supreme Court \nhas taken pains to carve the OSC out of its pronouncements concerning the President\u2019s broad \nauthority to remove officials who assist him in discharging his duties at will.  Moreover, the \nreasoning underlying the decisions relied upon by defendants does not extend to the unique office \nand official involved in this case. \nIn Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020), a party resisting a civil investigative \ndemand (\u201cCID\u201d) issued by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) challenged the \nlegitimacy of the agency\u2019s structure.  Id. at 208.  The Ninth Circuit upheld the for-cause removal \nprotection for the single head of the independent agency, agreeing with the en banc decision of the \nD.C. Circuit in PHH Corp. v. CFPB, 881 F.3d 75 (D.C. Cir. 2018).  See CFPB v. Seila Law LLC, \n923 F.3d 680, 682 (9th Cir. 2019).  The Supreme Court granted certiorari.  Because the government \nagreed with the petitioner on the constitutional issue, the Court appointed an amicus to defend the \njudgment of the Ninth Circuit.  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 209 \nThe Court began by repeating its prior holding that \u201c\u2018as a general matter,\u2019 the Constitution \ngives the President \u2018the authority to remove those who assist him in carrying out his duties.\u201d  Id. \nat 204, quoting Free Enterprise Fund v. Pub. Co. Acct. Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477, 513\u201314 \n(2010).  It explained that \u201c[t]he President\u2019s power to remove \u2013 and thus supervise \u2013 those who \nwield executive power on his behalf flows from the text of Article II,\u201d and that \u201c[w]ithout such \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/12/25     Page 10 of 27\npower, the President could not be held fully accountable for discharging his own responsibilities; \nthe buck would stop somewhere else.\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 204.   \nBut the Court did not announce a blanket rule that the President has the power to remove \nthe head of every independent agency led by a single director, as defendants would have this Court \nbelieve.  The Court held that the CFPB\u2019s leadership by a single individual removable only for \nstatutorily prescribed reasons violated the separation of powers, id. at 205, and it went into \nconsiderable detail as to why the Director of the CFPB in particular should not be shielded from \nPresidential control. \nBefore it turned its attention to the CFPB, the Court reviewed its prior decisions concerning \nthe President\u2019s removal power in general, and it repeated its observation in Humphrey\u2019s Executor \nv.  United  States,  295  U.S.  602,  631\u201332  (1935)  that  Congress\u2019s  ability  to  impose  removal \nrestrictions \u201cwill depend upon the character of the office.\u201d Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 215.  Humphrey\u2019s \nExecutor involved the President\u2019s authority to replace five members of the New Deal-era Federal \nTrade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), and looking at the agency as it was constituted in 1935, the Court \nheld that the restrictions on replacing the panel members were lawful.  Humphrey\u2019s Executor, 295 \nU.S. at 619, 623\u201325, 628\u201329.  In the Seila Law opinion, the Supreme Court listed some of the \ncircumstances that animated its opinion in Humphrey\u2019s Executor, and several of them pertain to \nthe OSC today:  the Court noted that the agency performed specified duties to aid the legislature, \nsuch as making investigations and reports to Congress, and like the OSC, the five member board \nof the FTC was \u201cdesigned to be non-partisan and to act with entire impartiality.\u201d Seila Law, 591 \nU.S. at 215\u201316 (internal quotation marks omitted).  The Seila Law Court also pointed out that \nHumphrey\u2019s Executor found that \u201c[t]he FTC\u2019s duties were \u2018neither political nor executive,\u2019 but \n10 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/12/25     Page 11 of 27\ninstead called for \u2018the trained judgment of a body of experts\u2019 \u2018informed by experience.\u2019\u201d  Id. at \n216, quoting 295 U.S. at 64.   \nHere  we  have  a  statute  that  incorporates  Congress\u2019s  judgment  with  respect  to  the \nqualifications to be the Special Counsel, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b) (\u201cThe Special Counsel shall be an \nattorney who, by demonstrated ability, background, training, or experience, is especially qualified \nto carry out the functions of the position.\u201d), as well as the restrictions on removal.  Id.  Seila Law \nsummed up Humphrey\u2019s Executive as recognizing the President\u2019s \u201cunrestrictable power . . . to \nremove purely executive officers,\u201d but it did not extend the principle to less obvious situations.  \nSeila Law, 591 U.S. at 217 (emphasis added). \nThe Seila Law court also chose not to walk away from the Court\u2019s decision in Morrison v. \nOlson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988) that upheld the statutory protection from removal afforded to an \nindependent counsel under the now-defunct Independent Counsel Act.  See Seila Law, 591 U.S. at \n217\u201318.  Even though the independent counsel was a single person exercising law enforcement \nfunctions typically performed by the executive branch, the Court held that the requirement of for-\ncause removal did not unduly interfere with the President\u2019s powers because the petitioner was \u201can \ninferior officer under the Appointments Clause, with limited jurisdiction and tenure and lacking \npolicymaking or significant administrative authority.\u201d  Morrison, 487 U.S. at 691.  While plaintiff \ndoes not argue here, and the Court would not presume to rule at this time that the Special Counsel \nis an \u201cinferior officer\u201d akin to a naval cadet engineer, see United States v. Perkins, 116 U.S. 483, \n485 (1886), it is relevant that like the independent counsel, plaintiff does not appear to have \npolicymaking or significant administrative authority. \nSeila Law then differentiated the agency officials it found were entitled to protection from \nremoval in Humphrey\u2019s Executor from the Director of the CFPB: \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/12/25     Page 12 of 27\n[T]he CFPB Director is hardly a mere legislative or judicial aid.  Instead of \nmaking reports and recommendations to Congress, as the 1935 FTC did, the \nDirector possesses the authority to promulgate binding rules fleshing out 19 \nfederal statutes, including a broad prohibition on unfair and deceptive \npractices  in  a  major  segment  of  the  U.S.  economy.  And  instead  of \nsubmitting recommended dispositions to an Article III court, the Director \nmay unilaterally issue final decisions awarding legal and equitable relief in \nadministrative adjudications.  Finally, the Director's enforcement authority \nincludes the power to seek daunting monetary penalties against private \nparties on behalf of the United States in federal court\u2014a quintessentially \nexecutive power not considered in Humphrey's Executor. \n                      \nSeila Law, 591 U.S. at 218\u201319.  And then it distinguished the Director of the CFPB from the \nindependent counsel in Morrison:    \nUnlike  the  independent  counsel,  who  lacked  policymaking  or \nadministrative  authority,  the  Director  has  the  sole  responsibility  to \nadminister 19 separate consumer-protection statutes that cover everything \nfrom credit cards and car payments to mortgages and student loans.  It is \ntrue that the independent counsel in Morrison was empowered to initiate \ncriminal investigations and prosecutions, and in that respect wielded core \nexecutive power.  But that power, while significant, was trained inward to \nhigh-ranking Governmental actors identified by others, and was confined to \na specified matter in which the Department of Justice had a potential \nconflict of interest.  By contrast, the CFPB Director has the authority to \nbring the coercive power of the state to bear on millions of private citizens \nand  businesses,  imposing  even  billion-dollar  penalties  through \nadministrative adjudications and civil actions. \n \nId. at 219.2   \nAll of this points to a conclusion that Seila Law does not answer the question presented in \nthis case.  While the Special Counsel\u2019s role is not entirely analogous to that of the FTC panel \n \n2   The Court also  observed that the CFPB does not  rely  on the annual  Congressional \nappropriations process, but it receives its funding directly from the Federal Reserve, which is also \nfunded outside the appropriations process. Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 207; see also id. at 225 (\u201cThe \nDirector does not even depend on Congress for annual appropriations.\u201d) and 226 (\u201cThe CFPB\u2019s \nreceipt of funds outside the appropriations process further aggravates the agency\u2019s threat to \nPresidential Control.\u201d).  The OSC does not present these concerns. \n  \n \n12 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/12/25     Page 13 of 27\nmembers from 1935 or an individual appointed under the old Independent Counsel Act, who was \nconfined to a single criminal prosecution, the circumstances do not present the sort of concerns \nthat troubled the Supreme Court when it looked at the functions assigned to the Director of the \nCFPB.   \nIndeed, the Chief Justice took the trouble to say just that.  \nThe CFPB\u2019s defenders tried to compare the agency to the OSC, but the Court resisted the \nanalogy:  \nThe  OSC  exercises  only  limited  jurisdiction  to  enforce  certain  rules \ngoverning Federal Government employers and employees.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1212.  It does not bind private parties at all or wield regulatory authority \ncomparable to the CFPB. \n   \n Id. at 221.3   \nThis Court\u2019s review of the statutory provisions establishing the Special Counsel\u2019s purview \nconfirms that the agency is not \u201ccomparable to the CFPB,\u201d id., and that Seila Law does not compel \nthe conclusion advanced by the defendants.  One can hardly describe the OSC as \u201can independent \nagency led by a single director and vested with significant executive power\u201d as Seila Law described \nthe CFPB.  Id. at 220 (emphasis added).  Therefore, the showing that the statute establishing the \n \n3    Before making this comparison, the Court did point out that while the OSC had been \nheaded by a single officer since 1978, its structure \u201cdrew a contemporaneous constitutional \nobjection from the Office of Legal Counsel under President Carter and a subsequent veto on \nconstitutional grounds by President Reagan.\u201d Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 221, citing Memorandum \nOpinion for the General Counsel, Civil Service Commission, 2 Op. O.L.C. 120, 122 (1978); Public \nPapers of the Presidents, Ronald Reagan, Vol. II, Oct. 26, 1988, 1391\u201392 (1991).  It is equally \nworth observing that notwithstanding that opinion, President Carter signed the legislation in 1978, \nand that after President Reagan\u2019s action in 1988, negotiations concerning the legislation continued, \nand President George H.W. Bush signed the Whistleblower Protection Act into law in 1989.   The \nCourt has not been provided with materials showing that any administration since then has sought \nto have the statute amended. \n \n13 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/12/25     Page 14 of 27\nOffice of Special Counsel has been unquestionably violated supports a finding that plaintiff has \nmade the necessary showing of a likelihood of success on the merits. \nThe holding in Collins v. Yellin,  594 U.S. 220 (2021), does not compel a different \nconclusion. The opinion reiterated the importance of guarding against new intrusions on the \nPresident\u2019s Article II powers, and it explained that the \u201cnature and breadth of an agency\u2019s \nauthority\u201d should not be \u201cdispositive in determining whether Congress may limit the President\u2019s \npower to remove its head.\u201d  Id. at 251\u201352.  The Court rejected the notion that it should apply \ndifferent rules depending on an agency\u2019s size, power, or perceived \u201cimportance.\u201d  Id. at 252\u201353.   \nBut when the court-appointed amicus curiae in that case warned that a decision invalidating the \nremoval restrictions in the Housing and Economic Recovery Act would call into question the \nconstitutionality of other agencies, including the OSC, the Court chose to reply, \u201c[n]one of these \nagencies is before us, and we do not comment on the constitutionality of any removal restriction \nthat applies to their officers.\u201d  Id. at 256 n.21.    \nAlso, while the opinion made clear that the number of individuals or businesses regulated \nby any particular agency should not be the touchstone, it noted that the agency in question, the \nFederal Housing Finance Agency, did in fact \u201cregulate[] a small number of Government-sponsored \nenterprises,\u201d receiving roughly half of its budget from those regulated entities.  Id. at 251.  It also \npointed out: \n[W]hile the CFPB has direct regulatory and enforcement authority over \npurely private individuals and businesses, the FHFA has regulatory and \nenforcement authority over two companies that dominate the secondary \nmortgage  market  an  have  the  power  to  reshape  the  housing \nsector . . . .  FHFA actions with respect to those companies could have an \nimmediate impact on millions of private individuals and the economy at \nlarge.    \n \n14 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/12/25     Page 15 of 27\nId. at 253; see also id. at 224 (\u201c[T]he President\u2019s removal powers serves important purposes \nregardless of whether the agency in question affects ordinary Americans by directly regulating \nthem or by taking actions that have a profound but indirect effect on their lives.\u201d)  These things \ncannot be said about the OSC, even if, like the FHFA, it is authorized to issue subpoenas.  See id. \nat 254.4 \nThe  OSC  is  not  an  agency  endowed  with  the  power  to  articulate,  implement, or \nenforce policy that affects a broad swath of the American public or its economy.  It does not have \nbroad rulemaking authority or wield substantial enforcement authority over private actors; it has \nno  authority  over  private  actors.    It  is  an  agency  with  limited  jurisdiction:  its  job  is  to \ninvestigate government  employees\u2019  allegations of  specifically  identified  prohibited  personnel \npractices, and where appropriate, to seek corrective or disciplinary action.  The agency\u2019s statutory \nfunctions require it to report directly to Congress about what it has found and whether any \nexecutive agency has stood in its way.  While the federal workforce includes a large number of \n \n4   It is notable that after Collins, the Office of Legal Counsel issued an opinion firmly \nconcluding that the combination of the rulings in Seila Law and Collins compelled the conclusion \nthat the protections against removing the Commissioner of the Social Security Administration \n(\u201cSSA\u201d) were constitutionally infirm.  Constitutionality of the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s \nTenure Protection, 45 Op. O.L.C. __, 1 (O.L.C. July 8, 2021).  But the OLC included an explicit \ncaveat that this vindication of the President\u2019s prerogative did not necessarily extend to the Office \nof Special Counsel.  See id. at 10 n.3 (\u201cThis opinion does not address the validity of tenure \nprotections conferred on the Special Counsel, whose removal restrictions implicate different \nconsiderations,\u201d  contrasting  the  massive  impact,  enormous  budget,  and  exceptionally  broad \nrulemaking authority of the SSA with the OSC\u2019s right to recommend regulatory changes); see also \nid. at 15, citing Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 217\u201318 (\u201cWe emphasize the limited scope of our conclusion \nregarding the [SSA] Commissioner.  It does not imply any similar determination with respect to \nthe validity of tenure protections conferred on other executive officials \u2013 for example, the Special \nCounsel,  another  single  member  agency  had  whose  removal  restrictions  implicate  different \nconsiderations,  such  as  the  Special  Counsel\u2019s  primary  investigative  function  and  \u2018limited \njurisdiction.\u2019\u201d). \n \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/12/25     Page 16 of 27\npeople, the Special Counsel is only called upon to interact with a small subset of them on an \nindividual basis, and only in connection with one aspect of their personal employment situations;  \nhe does not guide or direct them in any way in connection with the policies they will promulgate \nor implement in the course of that employment.  \n  In sum, the OSC is an independent agency headed by a single individual, but otherwise, it \ncannot be compared to those involved when the Supreme Court found the removal for cause \nrequirement to be an unconstitutional intrusion on Presidential power. \nIII.  Irreparable harm \nNext, the plaintiff must show that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of \npreliminary relief.  Winter, 555 U.S. at 20. \nThe D.C. Circuit \u201chas set a high standard for irreparable injury\u201d \u2013 it \u201c\u2018must be both certain \nand great; [and] it must be actual and not theoretical.\u2019\u201d  Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches, 454 \nF.3d at 297, quoting Wisc. Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (per curiam). \nThe same opinion instructs that \u201cthe injury must be beyond remediation.\u201d  Id.  It explains: \nThe key word in this consideration is irreparable. Mere injuries, \nhowever substantial, in terms of money, time and energy necessarily \nexpended in the absence of a stay are not enough. The possibility \nthat  adequate  compensatory  or  other  corrective  relief  will  be \navailable at a later date, in the ordinary course of litigation weighs \nheavily against a claim of irreparable harm.  \n \nId. (emphasis in original), quoting Va. Petroleum Jobbers Ass\u2019n v. FPC, 259 F.2d 921, 925 (D.C. \nCir. 1958). \n  Plaintiff asserts that being deprived of his \u201cstatutory entitlement to serve as the lawful \nagency head of OSC\u201d \u2013 his right to fulfill the five-year position created and defined by Congress \nto which he was nominated and confirmed by the Senate \u2013 has caused and will continue to cause \nhim to suffer irreparable harm.  Pl.\u2019s TRO at 14\u201315.  He submits that this is not something that can \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/12/25     Page 17 of 27\nbe remediated with economic damages, and it is compounded by the loss of the opportunity to \nfulfill the duty he owes to all federal employees, and whistleblowers in particular, regardless of \ntheir political affiliation, to be free from prohibited practices on the part of federal agencies.  See \nPl.\u2019s TRO at 15.   \nDefense counsel announced at the hearing that injunctive relief was completely foreclosed \nby Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61 (1974), which counsel represented to be \u201cbinding precedent \nthat job loss does not constitute irreparable harm.\u201d  Tr. at 4, 6.  Defendants backed away from that \noverstatement  in  their  written  submission  and  argued  that  under  Sampson,  \u201c[t]he  loss  of \ngovernment employment constitutes irreparable harm only in a genuinely extraordinary situation,\u201d \nDefs.\u2019 Opp. at 2 (internal quotations omitted), and they maintain that the circumstances in this case \ndo not meet that test.  \n  But that authority is entirely distinguishable. In Sampson, the district court temporarily \nenjoined the discharge of a \u201cprobationary employee\u201d from the General Services Administration \npending an administrative appeal to the Civil Service Commission.  Sampson, 415 U.S. at 62\u201363.  \nThe plaintiff claimed that the discharge, which came just four months after she started, would \ncause irreparable harm by depriving her of income and causing \u201cher to suffer the embarrassment \nof being wrongfully discharged.\u201d  Id. at 62\u201363, 66. \n  It is well established now, of course, that allegations of economic losses that can be cured \nwith money damages do not constitute irreparable harm.  But there is no claim for lost earnings or \ncompensation in the complaint. \nSampson held that while a district court \u201cis not totally without authority to grant interim \ninjunctive relief to a discharged [g]overnment employee,\u201d Sampson, 415 U.S. at 63, the claimed \nirreparable injury was insufficient to support a temporary injunction.  Id. at 92\u201393.  The Court \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/12/25     Page 18 of 27\nexplained that the irreparable harm must be \u201cin kind and degree to override\u201d three factors that the \ncourt should \u201cgive serious weight\u201d:  (1) the \u201cdisruptive effect which the grant of the temporary \nrelief\u201d has on the administrative process;  (2) \u201cthe well-established rule that the [g]overnment has \ntraditionally been granted the widest latitude in the dispatch of its own internal affairs\u201d; and (3) \n\u201cthe traditional unwillingness of courts . . . to enforce contracts for personal service.\u201d  Id. at 83 \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  But Sampson recognized that: \n[C]ases may arise in which the circumstances surrounding an employee\u2019s \ndischarge, together with the resultant effect on the employee, may so far \ndepart  from  the  normal  situation  that  irreparable  injury  might  be \nfound.  Such extraordinary cases are hard to define in advance of their \noccurrence . . . .  [W]e do not wish to be understood as foreclosing relief in \nthe genuinely extraordinary situation. Use of the court\u2019s injunctive power, \nhowever, when discharge of probationary employees is an issue, should be \nreserved for that situation rather than employed in the routine case. \n \nId. at 92 n.68.   \n \nThis is not a routine case.  There is no contract for personal services involved, and plaintiff \nis not a \u201cprobationary employee\u201d;  he was appointed to serve the statutory term of five years.  \nCompl. \u00b6 30.  The  Sampson  court observed that  it was \u201cdealing . . . not  with  a permanent \nGovernment employee, a class for which Congress has specified certain substantive and procedural \nprotections, but with a probationary employee, a class which Congress has specifically recognized \nas entitled to less comprehensive procedures.\u201d  Sampson, 415 U.S. at 80\u201381.  So, its analysis is of \nlittle utility here.  \nThere are no facts to suggest that an order maintaining Dellinger in the role he occupied \nfor the past year would have a \u201cdisruptive\u201d effect on any administrative process; if anything, it \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/12/25     Page 19 of 27\nwould be his removal that is disruptive, as he suggests.5  And while it may be that the government \ntraditionally has wide \u201clatitude\u201d in dispatching its internal affairs, whether it does or should have \nthat latitude in the face of a statutory provision to the contrary is the question at the heart of the \nmerits.   \nFurthermore, plaintiff\u2019s irreparable injury cannot be compared to the loss of income or \nembarrassment involved in the typical employment action, for which there are remedies that do \nnot involve equitable relief.  This case falls outside of the typical paradigm since the OSC is an \nindependent agency and the White House is not plaintiff\u2019s employer.  In short, plaintiff\u2019s injury \nstems directly from \u201cextraordinary\u201d circumstances as Sampson requires; namely, that for the first \ntime, a President has removed the Special Counsel from his statutorily prescribed term without \nany cause or explanation. \nPlaintiff relies on Berry v. Reagan, Civil Action No. 83-3182, 1983 WL 538 (D.D.C. Nov. \n14, 1983), and the Court finds it to be instructive although not on all fours with the instant \nsituation.  In Berry, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order and preliminary \ninjunction  \u201cto  enjoin  the  President . . . from  removing  them  as  Commissioners  of  the  U.S. \nCommission on Civil Rights.\u201d  Id. at *1.  The Commission was a \u201ctemporary, bipartisan agency \nestablished  by  Congress,\u201d  that  was  \u201ccomposed  of  six  members,  appointed  by  the \n \n5   By hanging their hat on Sampson, defendants imply that it would be too disruptive to the \nbusiness of the agency to have Special Counsel Dellinger resume his work.  But any disruption to \nthe work of the agency was occasioned by the White House.  It\u2019s as if the bull in the china shop \nlooked back over his shoulder and said, \u201cWhat a mess!\u201d  Moreover, any disruption caused by the \nproposed temporary restraining order would be minimal;  plaintiff served as Special Counsel from \nMarch 6, 2024 through the end of the workday on Friday, February 7, 2025.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 30,  He \nreceived the email announcing that his position was terminated later that evening, and according \nto defendants, the Acting Special Counsel took over on Monday morning.  By Monday night, this \nCourt had already entered an administrative stay restoring the Special Counsel to the position he\u2019d \noccupied for the prior year.  See Minute Order (Feb. 10, 2025).  Defendants have not proffered any \nfacts to show that maintaining this rapid return of the torch will affect agency operations. \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/12/25     Page 20 of 27\nPresident, . . . with  the  advice  and  consent  of  the  Senate,\u201d  who  investigated  and  collected \ninformation  \u201cregarding  deprivations  of  both  civil  rights  and  equal  administration  of \njustice.\u201d  Id.  To perform its function, the Commission was permitted to \u201chold hearings and issue \nsubpoenas for the attendance and testimony of witnesses and the production of evidence.\u201d  Id.  One \nmonth before the Commission was set to expire, President Regan terminated the plaintiffs from \nthe Commission.  Id. at 1, n.1.   \nBerry undertook to apply the Sampson test that \u201ca federal employee seeking injunctive \nrelief must make a strong showing of irreparable injury \u2018sufficient in kind and degree to override \nthe factors cutting against the general availability of preliminary injunctions [such as disruption of \nthe administrative process] in Government personnel cases.\u2019\u201d  Berry, 1983 WL 538 at *5, quoting \nSampson, 415 U.S. at 84.  It then explained that the \u201cdeprivation of [plaintiffs\u2019] statutory right to \nfunction as Commissioners until the Commission expires,\u201d and \u201ctheir unlawful removal from \noffice by the President\u201d did constitute irreparable injury.  Id.  The Court noted the \u201cobviously \ndisruptive effect\u201d that denial of preliminary relief would have on the Commission\u2019s final activities, \nincluding that it would leave the Commission \u201cwithout a quorum\u201d to conduct its mandated \n\u201cwind\u2013up\u201d duties.  Id.  The Court further stated it was \u201cnot clear that the President has the power \n \nto remove Commissioners at his discretion,\u201d and that the plaintiffs did not have \u201cadministrative, \nstatutory, or other relief that is readily available to many federal employees.\u201d  Id.   \nWhile the Special Counsel is not a \u201ctemporary\u201d employee with a set term in which his \nduties must be completed, plaintiff was appointed for a fixed term, and he has a statutory mission \nthat his removal has rendered him unable to fulfill:  to \u201cprotect employees, former employees, and \napplicants for employment from prohibited personnel practices.\u201d  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1212.  And the loss \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/12/25     Page 21 of 27\nof the ability to do what Congress specifically directed him to do cannot be remediated with \nanything other than equitable relief.6  \nDefendants insist, though, that there is authority that has already foreclosed the argument \nthat the deprivation of a \u201cstatutory right to function\u201d is irreparable harm.  Defs.\u2019 Opp. at 2.  They \nnote that in English v. Trump, 279 F. Supp. 3d 307 (D.D.C. 2018), \u201canother district court in this \nCircuit rejected the identical argument in analogous circumstances.\u201d  Defs.\u2019 Opp. at 2.  But putting \naside the point that district court opinions are not binding on this Court, the circumstances in \nEnglish are in no way \u201canalogous.\u201d  \nThe statute establishing the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau prescribes that the \nDeputy  Director  \u201cshall . . . serve  as  acting  Director  in  the  absence  or  unavailability  of  the \nDirector.\u201d  12 U.S.C. \u00a7 5491(b)(5).  In English, the Director of the CFPB resigned and named the \nplaintiff as his Deputy Director in what the court characterized as \u201can apparent attempt to select \nhis successor.\u201d  English, 279 F. Supp. 3d at 311.  Meanwhile, the President appointed a different \nacting Director pursuant to his power under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act of 1998.  Id.  The \nplaintiff filed suit to temporarily enjoin the President\u2019s pick from serving as the head of the CFPB \n \n6  Plaintiff directs the court to another district court opinion, Mackie v. Bush, 809 F. Supp. \n144 (D.D.C. 1993), but it is not comparable.  See Pl.\u2019s TRO at 15.  In Mackie, the plaintiffs were \nmembers of the Board of Governors of the Postal Service Board, which was \u201ca party to litigation \npending\u201d in the D.C. Circuit.  809 F. Supp. at 144\u2013145.  The President threatened to remove the \nplaintiffs if they did not withdraw from that lawsuit, and the district court temporarily enjoined \n\u201cremoval of the plaintiffs\u201d because the removal \u201ccould jeopardize\u201d the jurisdiction of the D.C. \nCircuit over the Postal Service Board\u2019s pending suit, which could have determined that the Board \nwas \u201cindependent.\u201d  Id. at 146.  The Court also noted that \u201cin the circumstances here, neither a \ndamages remedy nor a declaratory judgment would provide an adequate remedy\u201d because \u201cneither \na damage award in the Claims Court nor a declaratory judgment in [the district court] would afford \nour Court of Appeals, and thus the Judicial Branch, an opportunity to protect its jurisdiction over \na matter pending before it and the several issues lurking there.\u201d  Id. at 147 (footnote omitted).  So, \nthe procedural and jurisdictional concerns dictating temporary relief do not pertain here. \n   \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/12/25     Page 22 of 27\nand restrain the President from appointing any acting Director other than herself.  Id. at 315.  The \ncourt summarized the issue presented as \u201cwhether the President is authorized to name an acting \nDirector of the [CFPB] or whether his choice must yield to the ascension of the Deputy Director, \nwho was installed in that office by the outgoing Director in the hours before he resigned.\u201d  Id. at \n311.  The court denied the temporary relief on the grounds that the plaintiff had not demonstrated \na likelihood of success on the merits, not had she made a showing of the necessary irreparable \nharm.  Id. at 333, 336.  \nIn making that finding, the court looked to Sampson and it differentiated the case before it \nfrom the way Sampson was applied in Berry.  It noted that in Berry, the court considered the \nCommission\u2019s inability to complete its work and the individual plaintiffs\u2019 injury to be one and the \nsame:  the frustrated statutory objective also applied to each of them personally, as they could not \ndo what they had been appointed and confirmed to do.  Id. at 335.  But English, according to the \ncourt, did not identify any harm that she would suffer personally if the injunction did not issue, as \nthe work of the agency would go forward.  Id.  And while she may have been appointed as Deputy \nDirector in a manner that was arguably consistent with the governing statute, she did not occupy a \nposition established by Congress, for which she was subject to Senate confirmation, like the \nplaintiff in our case does. \nBut the more significant distinction drawn by the court in English was that \u201cin Berry, the \nplaintiffs were attempting to preserve a status quo in which they had a \u2018statutory right to function \nas Commissioners,\u2019 after they were appointed by President Carter, with the advice and consent of \nthe Senate, pursuant to the authorizing statute of the Commission.  In contrast, there was never a \ntime here in which English functioned as the CFPB\u2019s acting Director.\u201d  Id. (citation omitted).  In \nother words, the requested order requiring the President to withdraw his choice for acting Director \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/12/25     Page 23 of 27\nand name the plaintiff to that position would not restore the \u201cstatus quo,\u201d which is defined as the \n\u201clast uncontested status which preceded the pending controversy,\u201d  Id. at 335\u201336, citing District \n50, United Mine Workers of Am. v. Int\u2019l Union, United Mine Workers of Am., 412 F.2d 165, 168 \n(D.C. Cir. 1969).  Plaintiff had never been the acting Director, but she was simply picked by the \noutgoing Director to serve as his Deputy, who would be entitled to then ascend to the Director\u2019s \nposition.7   \nFinally, defendants argue that the harm is not irreparable because the OSC \u201ccontinues to \noperate\u201d with another individual \u201cfunctioning as acting Special Counsel.\u201d  Defs.\u2019 Opp. at 13 \n(internal quotations omitted); Tr. at 4 (\u201cThere is currently an acting special counsel who is another \nofficial from the Office of Special Counsel who is serving in that rule currently.\u201d).  Plaintiff \nsubmits that whether the agency is still up and running in some format, with some person at the \nhelm, is not the point.  He is concerned that in the absence of a leader lawfully appointed to fulfill \nthe statutory duties of the Special Counsel, there would be no way to ensure the confidentiality \nand continuity of ongoing matters under his purview, no clarity as to what employees who have \nbeen subjected to prohibited actions or retaliation should do or where they should turn, and no \n \n7   Defendants also argue that the harm is not irreparable because if plaintiff prevails in this \nlawsuit, he can be restored to his position then.  English did observe that while the harm suffered \nby the plaintiff Commissioners in Berry was irreparable because once the term of the Commission \nexpired, they could no longer be reappointed to it by a court, English could be reinstated to the \n\u201cActing\u201d Deputy slot if her suit succeeded. See English, 279 F. Supp. 3d at 335.  Here, plaintiff \nworries that unless he is restored to his position, the President could choose to fill the vacancy he \nunlawfully created, extinguishing any possible judicial remedy.  That appears to be less speculative \nthan the scenario rejected by the court in English, where the President had not just deposed the \nSenate-confirmed agency head.  But even if the Court were to find English to be instructive, it \nwould  not  advance  the  defendants\u2019  position  given  the  fundamental  difference  between  the \nequitable relief the plaintiff is seeking here and what was at issue in English.  Dellinger wants to \nmaintain  the  Presidential  appointment  he  held  until  his  removal;  English  was  seeking  an \nappointment to a position for which she was eligible, but she never received.  Moreover, English \nis not a fair comparator as she was not ejected from a Presidential appointment with a fixed term. \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/12/25     Page 24 of 27\nassurance that only people with appropriate authorization will access the confidential and sensitive \ninformation maintained by the OSC, including information it is required by statute to keep secret.  \nSee 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1213(h); Tr. at 18\u201319.  \n Plaintiff\u2019s assertion that it is irreparable harm to be deprived of the ability to perform his \nstatutory functions and fulfill  his  statutory obligations to  current  and future whistleblowers \noverlaps considerably with his argument on the merits:  that it is Congress that established his \nposition, his duties, and the sole grounds for his removal, and that the structure of the OSC reflects \na Congressional determination that his independence is fundamental to the position it created.  One \nproblem in English was that the Court found that the complaint failed on the merits, while this \nCourt has already found that plaintiff has made a strong showing of success on the merits.  Since \nit also it finds that he has made a sufficient showing, for now, that these harms are indeed \nsignificant, impending, and irreparable, it will, consistent with Winter and Sherley, go on to the \nthird and fourth factors. \nIV.   The balance of the equities and the public interest \nPlaintiff advances the arguments concerning the third and fourth factors together, Pl.\u2019s \nTRO at 16\u201317, and defendants\u2019 response addresses them together as well.  Defs.\u2019s Opp. at 14\u201315.  \nThe Court agrees that in this case, they are necessarily intertwined:  plaintiff is a public official \nsuing public officials, and both the scope of legitimate Presidential authority and the existence and \nextent of any remedies available to displaced civil servants and officials are very much matters of \npublic interest. \n  Plaintiff maintains that recent \u201cpersonnel actions have generated widespread uncertainty,\u201d \nand that \u201c[i]n this context, the proper functioning of the OSC is more vital than ever.\u201d  Pl.\u2019s TRO \nat 16.  According to plaintiff, his termination \u201ccreates a gap in protections provided by the OSC, \n24 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/12/25     Page 25 of 27\nrisking severe confusion over the leadership, mission, and role of the agency (as well as doubt over \nthe lawfulness of any actions that it takes and fear that confidential information may fall into \nunauthorized hands).\u201d  Id.   \nFor purposes of the temporary restraining order, the Court can and will consider these \nfactors without characterizing or purporting to address the lawfulness of Presidential actions that \nhave not been presented to it for review and may well be the subject of proceedings before other \ncourts.    \nDefendants tie their argument to the merits:  that the relief requested would cause harm to \nthe Executive and to the separation of powers by intruding on his Article II authority.  Defs.\u2019 Opp. \nat 2, 14\u201315.  But they proffer no circumstances that required the President\u2019s hasty, unexplained \naction, or that would justify the immediate ejection of the Senate-confirmed Special Counsel while \nthe legal issue is subject to calm and thorough deliberation. \n The Office of Special Counsel is a unique federal agency with a unique, but narrow focus.  \nCongress created the position of Special Counsel to play a singular and important role that has \nstrong bipartisan support:  to protect whistleblowers within the executive branch from reprisals \nand prohibited personnel practices, even as administrations change hands.  See Whistleblower \nProtection Act of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101\u201312, 103 Stat. 16 (Apr. 10, 1989) (\u201c[T]he primary role of \nthe Office of Special Counsel is to protect employees, especially whistleblowers, from prohibited \npersonnel practices[.]\u201d).  Notwithstanding defendants\u2019 assertion, unsupported by any authority, \nthat  \u201cthe  public  interest  is  better  served  by  a  Special  Counsel  who  holds  the  President\u2019s \nconfidence,\u201d Defs.\u2019 Opp. at 15, Congress contemplated and established a structure that reflects a \ndifferent priority.  Independence is essential to any Special Counsel\u2019s ability to perform the unique \nset of duties and reporting requirements set forth in the statute.  Defendants have identified no \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/12/25     Page 26 of 27\nimpending injury or alleged constitutional error that cannot be fixed in the future that would \noutweigh the harm that will flow from the precise circumstance Congress deliberately chose to \nprohibit.  Therefore, the Court finds that the last two factors weigh heavily in favor of the \ntemporary restraining order. \nCONCLUSION \n \nFor the reasons set forth above, plaintiff\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order \n[Dkt. # 2] is GRANTED.  \nIt is hereby ORDERED that from the date of entry of this order until the Court rules on \nthe entry of a preliminary injunction, plaintiff Hampton Dellinger shall continue to serve as the \nSpecial Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel, the position he occupied at 7:22 p.m. on Friday, \nFebruary 7, 2025 when he received the email from the Assistant to the President.  Defendants may \nnot deny him access to the resources or materials of that office or recognize the authority of any \nother person as Special Counsel.  \nIn light of this Order, the administrative stay entered on February 10, 2025, see Minute \nOrder  (Feb.  10,  2025)  is  hereby  VACATED,  and  defendants\u2019  motion  to  stay  the  Court\u2019s \nadministrative stay [Dkt. # 10], which was never granted, is DENIED AS MOOT.8   \n \n8   Putting aside the question of whether 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 3345 gives the President authority to \nappoint an Acting Special Counsel under the circumstances here, the appointment described in \ndefendants\u2019 Notice [Dkt. # 13] as having taken place on February 11, 2025 may have been contrary \nto the order the Court issued on February 10th.  See Minute Order (Feb. 10, 2025) (\u201c[I]t is HEREBY \nORDERED that from the time of this order through midnight on February 13, 2025, plaintiff \nHampton Dellinger shall continue to serve as the Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel, \nthe position he occupied at 7:22 p.m. on Friday, February 7, 2025 . . . .\u201d).  As of that date, there \nwas no vacancy to fill. \n  \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 14     Filed 02/12/25     Page 27 of 27\nThe Court will hold a hearing on plaintiff\u2019s request for an injunction pending resolution of \nthe case on the merits, i.e., an appealable preliminary injunction, on February 26, at 10:00 a.m. \nThe parties are directed to confer and inform the court by February 14 of their position (or \npositions if they do not agree) on whether, given the legal nature of the dispute, the Court should \nconsolidate consideration of the request for a preliminary injunction with consideration of the \nmerits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2), and they must submit a proposed \nschedule for any additional submissions they believe are warranted.  The parties may propose that \nthe Court deem the motion in support of the temporary restraining order to be a memorandum in \nsupport of a motion for preliminary injunction, with the opposition and reply similarly designated, \nand/or existing pleadings can be deemed to be motions and oppositions or cross motions under \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 56.  The Court notes that an order of consolidation does not require \nthe consent of the parties. \n  SO ORDERED. \n \n \n \n \nAMY BERMAN JACKSON \nUnited States District Judge \n \nDATE:  February 12, 2025  \n27\n\nClearinghouse file: https://clearinghouse-umich-production.s3.amazonaws.com/media/doc/155426.pdf\nExternal link: https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69636261/01208710322/hampton-dellinger-v-scott-bessent/\nClearinghouse summary: clearinghouse.net/doc/155426"

Barrett Prettyman U.S. Courthouse \n333 Constitution Avenue NW \nWashington, D.C. 20001 \n \nRE:  Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5052 \n \nDear Mr. Cislak: \n \nWe  write  in  response  to  plaintiff\u2019s  letter  asserting  that  \u201cthere  is \npresently no live appeal for this Court to address.\u201d  The assertion is \nplainly incorrect.  The government is currently subject to a permanent \ninjunction, which is stayed only by virtue of this Court\u2019s order in this \nappeal.    This  appeal  remains  live  unless  and  until  the  permanent \ninjunction from which it arises is dissolved and plaintiff\u2019s complaint is \ndismissed with prejudice.  Plaintiff\u2019s \u201cfinal and public decision\u201d to \ncease  \u201cpursu[ing]  judicial  relief\u201d  is  not,  in  fact,  equivalent  to \ndismissing the underlying litigation and dissolving the injunction in \nplaintiff\u2019s favor.   \nPlaintiff\u2019s  assertion  that  he  is  \u201cnegotiating  with  the  government \nregarding the proper next steps to bring this litigation to an end\u201d is \nalso curious.  Plaintiff has not proposed any stipulation under Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 41(a)(1) or sought our consent to a motion under Fed. R. Civ. P. \n41(a)(2).  Plaintiff has communicated that he would \u201ctake[] no position \non  a  motion  to  vacate  the  underlying  judgment.\u201d  But  that  only \nconfirms that this appeal is not moot.  Again, the appeal will become \n\nmoot only if and when the permanent injunction from which it arises \nis dissolved and plaintiff\u2019s complaint is dismissed with prejudice\u2014a \nresult that plaintiff so far has made no effort to effectuate. \nEven under plaintiff\u2019s view, moreover, this Court would still have \njurisdiction to issue an opinion explaining its stay order, as the Court \nstated it would.  Plaintiff\u2019s statements today appear to be an attempt \nto prevent the issuance of that opinion, which is all the more reason \nfor the Court not to abide his procedural gamesmanship.  As other \ncourts  of  appeals  have  recognized,  the  \u201cpractice  of  bifurcating  an \nexpedited order with its reasoning is common, often necessary, and \nconstitutional,\u201d even if the case becomes moot between the issuance of \nthe order and the release of the opinion.

The TRO\nmandates that Hampton Dellinger \u201ccontinue to serve as the Special Counsel of the\nOffice of Special Counsel,\u201d even though the President, acting through the Presidential\nPersonnel Office, sought to remove Dellinger from that position on February 7, 2025. \nOrder Granting TRO, Dellinger v. Bessent, 25-cv-385 (ABJ), at 26 (D.D.C. Feb. 12,\n2025), ECF No. 14.  The TRO is in place for only fourteen days, until February 26,\n2025, when the district court will hold a hearing on Dellinger\u2019s motion for a preliminary\ninjunction.  If granted, a preliminary injunction would extend relief through the pendency\nof the case, i.e., until the case is resolved on the merits.\n* A statement by Circuit Judge Katsas, dissenting from this order, is attached.\n\nUSCA Case #25-5028      Document #2100953            Filed: 02/15/2025      Page 2 of 27\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n____________\nNo. 25-5028 September Term, 2024\nAlthough a TRO ordinarily is not an appealable order, the government asks us to\nmake an exception and hear its appeal because the TRO \u201cworks an extraordinary\nharm\u201d and is set to last for fourteen days.  Stay Mot. 8\u20139.  Alternatively, the government\nrequests that we construe its stay motion as a petition for a writ of mandamus and grant\nthe petition, which would have the effect of reversing the TRO.  The government filed its\nappeal and stay motion on the evening of February 12, 2025, and requested a ruling\nfrom this court within two days, by noon on February 14, 2025, so that the Acting\nSolicitor General \u201chas the opportunity to seek expeditious review from the Supreme\nCourt if this Court denies relief.\u201d  Id. at 3.\nThe relief requested by the government is a sharp departure from established\nprocedures that balance and protect the interests of litigants, and ensure the orderly\nconsideration of cases before the district court and this court.  Instead of entertaining an\nemergency appeal of a TRO, the normal course would be for us to wait for the district\ncourt to issue a ruling on the preliminary injunction, which would be immediately\nappealable.  Indeed, many of the issues raised in the stay motion will be addressed by\nthe district court at the preliminary-injunction hearing on February 26, 2025.  The district\ncourt has promised to issue its preliminary-injunction ruling with \u201cextreme expedition.\u201d\n Order Denying Stay Mot., Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-385 (ABJ), at 2 (D.D.C. Feb. 13,\n2025), ECF No. 19.  Moreover, that ruling will rest upon a more complete record for our\nreview, and an appeal of the preliminary-injunction decision will not require us to act\nwithin the fourteen-day lifespan of a TRO, in a case that raises weighty constitutional\nissues.\nBecause it would be inconsistent with governing legal standards and ill-advised\nto hold that a TRO is appealable based solely on unsubstantiated claims of\n\u201cextraordinary harm\u201d for fourteen days, we decline to treat the TRO as an appealable\ninjunction.  Nor has the government established its entitlement to the extraordinary\nremedy of mandamus.  We therefore dismiss the appeal, dismiss the stay motion as\nmoot, and deny the petition for a writ of mandamus.\nI.\nThe Office of Special Counsel (\u201cOSC\u201d) is an independent agency of the United\nStates that \u201csafeguard[s] employees . . . who \u2018blow the whistle\u2019 on illegal or improper\nofficial conduct.\u201d  Wren v.

By statutory mandate, \u201c[t]he Special Counsel may be removed by the\nPresident only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d  Id.\nOn October 3, 2023, then-President Biden nominated Hampton Dellinger to be\nSpecial Counsel of OSC.  The Senate confirmed Dellinger, and he took office on March\n6, 2024.  His five-year term expires in 2029.  But at 7:22 p.m. on February 7, 2025,\nDellinger received an email from the Director of the Presidential Personnel Office,\nSergio Gor.  The email stated:  \u201cOn behalf of President Donald J. Trump, I am writing to\ninform you that your position as Special Counsel of the US Office of Special Counsel is\nterminated, effective immediately.  Thank you for your service[.]\u201d\nOn February 10, 2025, Dellinger filed a civil action in the district court against\nPresident Trump, Gor, the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, the\nSecretary of the Treasury, the Acting Special Counsel of OSC, and the Chief Operating\nOfficer of OSC.  In relevant part, the complaint asserted that Dellinger\u2019s removal\nviolated 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b) because his removal was not \u201cfor inefficiency, neglect of\nduty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d  He sought an order declaring that his removal was\nunlawful and that he remains Special Counsel and must be fully treated as such. \nDellinger also sought a TRO enjoining the defendants from removing him from his post\npending further consideration of the merits.  \nThat afternoon, the district court held a hearing to discuss whether a TRO should\nbe entered.  To allow time for briefing and consideration of the TRO request, the district\ncourt issued a three-day \u201cadministrative stay\u201d \u201cto preserve the status quo\u201d that existed\nbefore the White House sought to remove Dellinger.  Min. Order Issuing Admin. Stay,\nDellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-385 (ABJ) (D.D.C. Feb. 10, 2025).  The administrative stay\nprovided that \u201cthrough midnight on February 13, 2025, plaintiff Hampton Dellinger shall\ncontinue to serve as the Special Counsel,\u201d and that \u201cthe defendants may not deny him\naccess to the resources or materials of that office or recognize the authority of any\nother person as Special Counsel.\u201d  Id. \nThat evening, the government noticed an appeal of the district court\u2019s\nadministrative stay.  The government then filed an emergency motion in this court,\nseeking to stay the administrative stay.  The government argued that this court had\njurisdiction over the administrative-stay order because it was \u201cin substance a temporary\nrestraining order\u201d that is \u201cakin to [an] injunction[],\u201d which is appealable under 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1292(a)(1).  1st Stay Mot. 18\u201320.  The government also argued that if the court\nPage 3\n\nUSCA Case #25-5028      Document #2100953            Filed: 02/15/2025      Page 4 of 27\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n____________\nNo. 25-5028 September Term, 2024\nconcluded that the administrative stay was not appealable, the court should treat the\ngovernment\u2019s motion as a mandamus petition and grant it.  Id.\nDuring the pendency of the appeal of the administrative stay, on February 11,\n2025, the President designated Doug Collins, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, as\nActing Special Counsel.  Later that day, we dismissed the administrative-stay appeal for\nlack of jurisdiction because the government had not shown that the district court\u2019s\nminute order \u201chad the effect of granting an injunction that is appealable under 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1292(a)(1).\u201d  Order, Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5025 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 11, 2025).  We\nalso ruled that the government had not demonstrated its entitlement to the\nextraordinary remedy of mandamus.  \nOn February 12, 2025, the district court vacated the administrative stay and\ngranted Dellinger\u2019s motion for a TRO.  The TRO mandates that, until the district court\nrules on Dellinger\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction, \u201cDellinger shall continue to\nserve as Special Counsel\u201d and \u201c[d]efendants may not deny him access to the resources\nor materials of that office or recognize the authority of any other person as Special\nCounsel.\u201d  Order Granting TRO 26.  The district court scheduled a\npreliminary-injunction hearing for February 26, 2025, fourteen days later.  Moreover, the\ndistrict court directed the parties to inform the court whether it should \u201cconsolidate\nconsideration of the request for a preliminary injunction with consideration of the merits\u201d\nand whether further briefing was warranted.  Id. at 27.\nThat night, the government noticed an appeal of the TRO and asked the district\ncourt to stay the TRO pending appeal.  The district court denied the motion to stay.  On\nFebruary 13, 2025, the government filed an emergency motion in this court, asking us\nto stay the TRO pending appeal or, in the alternative, provide mandamus relief.  In\nresponse, Dellinger argues that this court lacks jurisdiction over the TRO and that the\ngovernment fails to support its request for mandamus relief. \nPage 4\n\nUSCA Case #25-5028      Document #2100953            Filed: 02/15/2025      Page 5 of 27\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n____________\nNo. 25-5028 September Term, 2024\nII.\nThe crux of the case before the district court is whether the President had\nauthority to remove Dellinger from his post as Special Counsel without any finding of\n\u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office,\u201d as required by 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1211(b).  The outcome will turn on whether the statute\u2019s constraint on the President\u2019s\nremoval power is constitutional:  The government contends that the law is\nunconstitutional and can have no effect, while Dellinger asserts that the statute does\nnot violate the Constitution and he is entitled to its protections.  To determine the\nparties\u2019 rights and obligations for now, until that dispute is resolved, the district court is\nfollowing procedures prescribed by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure regarding the\nissuance of TROs and preliminary injunctions.     \nRule 65 authorizes a district court to issue a TRO or a preliminary injunction to\nprevent irreparable injury and to preserve the status quo while the district court\nassesses the merits of a case.  See Cobell v. Kempthorne, 455 F.3d 301, 314 (D.C. Cir.\n2006) (\u201cThe usual role of a preliminary injunction is to preserve the status quo pending\nthe outcome of litigation.\u201d (cleaned up)); Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395\n(1981) (same); Wright & Miller, 11A Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. \u00a7 2951 (3d ed. June 2024\nupdate) (observing that TROs are \u201cdesigned to preserve the status quo until there is an\nopportunity to hold a hearing on the application for a preliminary injunction\u201d); see also\nFed. R. Civ. P. 65(a), (b).  As Justice Holmes explained, until the district court can\ndetermine how to proceed, \u201cit ha[s] authority, from the necessity of the case, to make\norders to preserve the existing conditions and the subject of the petition,\u201d as \u201cthe law\ncontemplates the possibility of a decision either way, and therefore must provide for it.\u201d \nUnited States v. Shipp, 203 U.S. 563, 573 (1906) (Holmes, J.).  \nA TRO often is used to provide immediate relief upon the filing of a lawsuit and\nmay be issued without notice to the adverse party.  See Fed. R. Civ.

But a\nTRO \u201cexpires at the time after entry \u2014 not to exceed 14 days \u2014 that the court sets,\nunless before that time the court, for good cause, extends it for a like period or the\nadverse party consents to a longer extension.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(b)(2).  Beyond the\ntimeframe of a TRO, the district court may grant a preliminary injunction to provide relief\nthat extends until the lawsuit is resolved.  The standard for obtaining either a TRO or a\npreliminary injunction is identical.  See Gordon v. Holder, 632 F.3d 722, 723\u201324 (D.C.\nCir. 2011).  The party seeking such relief \u201cmust establish that he is likely to succeed on\nthe merits, that he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief,\nthat the balance of equities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in the public\ninterest.\u201d  Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008).

Such a hearing\nallows the court to apply the applicable legal standard with the benefit of briefing,\nevidence (if necessary), and oral argument.  See Order Denying Stay Mot. 2 (\u201cThe\nCourt respects the importance of the matter and the Article II powers and\nresponsibilities defendants are seeking to vindicate, and that is precisely why full\nbriefing and a hearing are required.\u201d).\nPreliminary injunctions are appealable, but TROs generally are not.  \u201cUnder 28\nU.S.C. \u00a7 1291, our appellate jurisdiction generally extends only to the \u2018final decisions\u2019 of\ndistrict courts.\u201d  Salazar ex rel. Salazar v. District of Columbia, 671 F.3d 1258, 1261\n(D.C. Cir. 2012).

Prac. & Proc. Civ. \u00a7 2951 (3d ed. June 2024 update); see also\nAdams v. Vance, 570 F.2d 950, 953 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (\u201cThe grant of a temporary\nrestraining order under Rule 65(b), Fed. R. Civ. P., is generally not appealable.\u201d).  \nNevertheless, we have held that \u201cthe label attached to an order by the trial court\nis not decisive with regard to whether it falls under Rule 65(a) [as a preliminary\ninjunction] or Rule 65(b) [as a TRO] and the appellate court will look to other factors to\ndetermine whether an appeal should be allowed.\u2019\u201d  Adams, 570 F.2d at 953 (cleaned\nup).  In Adams, we held that \u201c[t]he order\u201d under review \u201cwas in purpose and effect a\nmandatory injunction appealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1)\u201d because \u201c[i]t did not\nmerely preserve the status quo pending further proceedings, but commanded an\nunprecedented action irreversibly altering the delicate diplomatic balance in the\nenvironmental arena.\u201d  Id.  We explained that \u201c[w]hen an order directs action so potent\nwith consequences so irretrievable, we provide an immediate appeal to protect the\nrights of the parties.\u201d  Id.

As Judge Friendly observed, it is \u201cthe rare case\u201d when denial\nof a TRO is effectively the denial of a preliminary injunction and thus appealable.  Hoh\nv. Pepsico, Inc., 491 F.2d 556, 559\u201360 (2d Cir. 1974) (Friendly, J.).\nWhether the granting, denying, or dissolving of a TRO is appealable depends on\nwhether the disputed order should be treated as a preliminary injunction, and in making\nthat determination courts generally look to several factors.  As particularly relevant to\nthis case and discussed in more detail infra, courts consider whether the order had \nirreparable consequences that warrant immediate relief.  See, e.g., Berrigan v. Sigler,\nPage 6\n\nUSCA Case #25-5028      Document #2100953            Filed: 02/15/2025      Page 7 of 27\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n____________\nNo. 25-5028 September Term, 2024\n475 F.2d 918, 919 (D.C.

Fund, Inc. v. Ruckelshaus, 439 F.2d 584,\n590 n.8 (D.C.

Murray, 415 U.S.\n61, 86 (1974) (endorsing view that \u201ca temporary restraining order continued beyond the\ntime permissible under Rule 65 must be treated as a preliminary injunction, and must\nconform to the standards applicable to preliminary injunctions\u201d); (2) whether the district\ncourt entered the order after a contested hearing, akin to a hearing held on a motion for\npreliminary injunction, see, e.g., United States v. Hubbard, 650 F.2d 293, 314 n.73\n(D.C. Cir. 1980) (explaining that denial of TRO was \u201cequatable to denial of a preliminary\ninjunction\u201d \u201cbecause the denial came only after the Church was heard on the merits\u201d\n(citing Sampson, 415 U.S. at 86\u201388)); and (3) whether the order foreclosed future\naction for injunctive relief, see, e.g., Belbacha v. Bush, 520 F.3d 452, 455 (D.C. Cir.\n2008) (\u201cAlthough the district court characterized the relief [appellant] seeks as a\n\u2018temporary restraining order,\u2019 that court\u2019s order dismissing his motion \u2018effectively\nforeclose[s]\u2019 [appellant] \u2018from pursuing further interlocutory relief in the form of a\npreliminary injunction,\u2019 and is therefore \u2018tantamount to denial of a preliminary injunction,\u2019\nappealable under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1).\u201d (quoting Levesque v.

Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375,\n377 (1994) (party asserting court\u2019s jurisdiction has the burden of establishing\njurisdiction).  Although a TRO is \u201cgenerally not appealable,\u201d Adams, 570 F.2d at 953,\nthe government claims that the instant TRO is, in fact, an injunction because:  (1) the\ndistrict court\u2019s \u201corder works an extraordinary harm to the President\u2019s authority over the\nExecutive Branch by reinstating the principal officer of a single-headed agency after the\nPresident\u2019s removal of the officer,\u201d Stay Mot. 8; and (2) \u201cthe district court has now\nconsiderably prolonged that harm by setting its TRO to last for 14 days, on top of the\ntwo-day duration of its \u2018administrative stay,\u2019\u201d id. at 9.  We are unpersuaded that the\ncited reasons make the TRO appealable; and we decline to set a precedent that would\nenable litigants to file appeals of TROs based solely on unsubstantiated claims of\n\u201cextraordinary harm\u201d during the period that the TRO is in effect.    \nThe relief requested by the government is itself extraordinary:  The government\nasks us to resolve disputed issues that plainly have not been finally adjudicated by the\ndistrict court.  The litigation of Dellinger\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction is ongoing\nin the court below, and that litigation raises issues that are overlapping, if not identical,\nto those that would be presented in an appeal of the TRO.  Moreover, the district court\nhas stated its intention to rule on the preliminary injunction with \u201cextreme expedition,\u201d\nand any appeal of the TRO must be resolved before February 26, when the TRO\nexpires (which presumably would render the appeal moot).  If we ruled on an appeal of\nthe TRO or the stay motion by February 26, our ruling would disrupt, if not render\nobsolete, the proceedings in the district court.  For example, our ruling on the stay\nmotion necessarily would include analysis of the parties\u2019 likelihood of success on the\nmerits.  See Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 434 (2009) (standard for stay pending\nappeal); see also Dissent 7\u201310 (analyzing likelihood of success on the merits).  It is\nunclear how the district court could make an independent ruling on the preliminary-\ninjunction motion or the merits of the case if we prejudged such a significant issue in\nadvance of the February 26 hearing.  In short, a decision by this court to opine on\nsubstantial legal issues at this point in the litigation, before the district court has finished\nits work and issued a ruling on the preliminary injunction, would throw a monkey wrench\ninto the district court proceedings.  See Salazar, 671 F.3d at 1261 (although limiting\nappellate jurisdiction only to final decisions \u201cnecessarily delays the resolution of\nimportant legal questions, Congress has determined that such delay must be tolerated\nin order to avoid \u2018the debilitating effect on judicial administration\u2019 that would otherwise\nresult from \u2018piecemeal appe[llate] disposition of what is, in practical consequence, but a\nsingle controversy\u2019\u201d) (quoting Coopers & Lybrand v. Livesay, 437 U.S. 463, 471 (1978));\nPage 8\n\nUSCA Case #25-5028      Document #2100953            Filed: 02/15/2025      Page 9 of 27\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n____________\nNo. 25-5028 September Term, 2024\ncf. In re Flynn, 973 F.3d 74, 79 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (en banc) (noting in the mandamus\ncontext \u201c[t]he interest in allowing the District Court to decide a pending motion in the\nfirst instance\u201d).\nGranting a stay of the TRO under the present circumstances would set a\nproblematic precedent.  If we were to accept the proposition that a party\u2019s bare\nassertion of \u201cextraordinary harm\u201d for fourteen days can render a TRO appealable, many\nlitigants subject to TROs would be encouraged to appeal them and to seek a stay. \nFourteen days is a standard lifespan for a TRO, and any TRO, by its nature, grants\nemergency relief that is likely to do perceived harm to someone.  Thus, at a time when\nemergency litigation is becoming more prevalent, we surely would be faced with a\ndeluge of TRO appeals.  And, like in this case, each of those appeals would be litigated\nat a breakneck pace to avoid mootness and to preserve the parties\u2019 ability to appeal our\nruling to the Supreme Court before the fourteen-day clock ran out.  We see no reason\nto incentivize more requests for two-day rulings when the appeal of preliminary\ninjunctions in the normal course has heretofore been adequate to protect the interests\nof litigants, including the government, in the vast majority of cases.  \nThe government and our dissenting colleague lean heavily on the importance of\nthe constitutional dispute in this case, and the prospect of \u201cextraordinary harm\u201d to the\nExecutive\u2019s Article II prerogatives if the Special Counsel post is not immediately filled by\nan individual of the President\u2019s choosing.  But the interests asserted by the government\nwill be vindicated on an expedited basis in the preliminary-injunction proceedings:  In\njust two weeks, the district court might rule in favor of the government; and if it does not,\nthe government can appeal any contrary ruling.  Waiting two weeks to make arguments\nto the district court and then, potentially, to this court is not so prejudicial to the\ngovernment\u2019s interests that we must rush to issue a ruling in two days, while scrambling\nthe normal appellate process.  \nBut even more fundamentally, the \u201cextraordinary harm\u201d argument adopted by the\ngovernment and the dissent is analytically flawed because it presumes that the\ngovernment is correct on the merits.  The cited \u201cextraordinary harm\u201d is the incursion on\nthe President\u2019s authority to remove executive-branch officials at will \u2014 but the legality of\nsuch constraints in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b) is the very merits issue that has not yet been\nadjudicated by the district court.  We cannot presume \u201cextraordinary harm\u201d without\npresuming that section 1211(b) is unconstitutional, and presuming the invalidity of a\nduly enacted statute is the opposite of what courts normally do.  See Rostker v.\nGoldberg, 453 U.S. 57, 64 (1981) (\u201cWhenever called upon to judge the constitutionality\nof an Act of Congress . . . the Court accords \u2018great weight to the decisions of\nPage 9\n\nUSCA Case #25-5028      Document #2100953            Filed: 02/15/2025      Page 10 of 27\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n____________\nNo. 25-5028 September Term, 2024\nCongress.\u2019\u201d (quoting Columbia Broad. Sys., Inc. v. Democratic Nat\u2019l Comm., 412 U.S.\n94, 102 (1973)).\nOur dissenting colleague deems the TRO \u201cextraordinary\u201d because it \u201cdirects the\nPresident to recognize and work with an agency head whom he has already removed.\u201d \nDissent 4.  That assertion declines to recognize the possibility that the removal may\nhave been unlawful.  Congress, a coequal branch of government, enacted section\n1211(b), which was signed into law by President Carter.  That statute explicitly states: \n\u201cThe Special Counsel may be removed by the President only for inefficiency, neglect of\nduty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b).  There is no dispute that the\nPresident violated the statute by not making any finding of \u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty,\nor malfeasance in office\u201d before removing Dellinger.  The district court granted the TRO\nonly after it made a finding that Dellinger\u2019s argument that the statute is constitutional\nand binding is likely to succeed on the merits.  See Order Granting TRO 8\u201316.  The\ndissent nevertheless appears to take the position that any time the President merely\nalleges or argues that his Article II powers have been infringed, he is entitled to\nimmediate appellate review.  Dissent 5 (\u201cWhere a lower court allegedly impinges on the\nPresident\u2019s core Article II powers, immediate appellate review should be generally\navailable.\u201d).  And yet, none of the authorities cited by the government or the dissent\nhold that the rules of civil procedure and appellate jurisdiction are suspended when the\nPresident is included as a party to a lawsuit.  Cf. Fed. Open Mkt. Comm. of Fed. Rsrv.\nSys. v. Merrill, 443 U.S. 340, 356 (1979) (\u201cThe Federal Rules [of Civil Procedure], of\ncourse, are fully applicable to the United States as a party.\u201d).  The question here is not\nwhether the President is entitled to prompt review of his important constitutional\narguments.  Of course he is.  The issue before us is whether his mere claim of\nextraordinary harm justifies this court\u2019s immediate review, which would essentially\nremove the legal issues from the district court\u2019s ambit before its proceedings have\nconcluded.1\n1  In addition, although the government does not raise this argument, the dissent\nsuggests that the district court\u2019s TRO improperly enjoined the President himself.  See\nDissent 5\u20136 (citing Mississippi v. Johnson, 71 U.S. 475 (1866)).  To be sure, \u201cin\ngeneral\u201d a court may not \u201cenjoin the President in the performance of his official duties.\u201d \nFranklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 802\u201303 (1992) (plurality opinion) (quoting\nJohnson, 71 U.S. at 501).  But that principle is beside the point because a court can\nunquestionably review the legality of the President\u2019s action by enjoining the officers who\nwould attempt to enforce the President\u2019s order.  See, e.g., Youngstown Sheet & Tube\nCo. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952).  So, in this case, the TRO is properly read as not\napplying directly to the President but rather to the other defendants acting on his behalf.\nPage 10\n\nUSCA Case #25-5028      Document #2100953            Filed: 02/15/2025      Page 11 of 27\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n____________\nNo. 25-5028 September Term, 2024\nOur dissenting colleague suggests that we should proceed with a premature\nreview of the merits of this case because the district court \u201cthoroughly addressed\u201d the\nconstitutional questions presented, which are \u201cpurely legal in nature.\u201d  Dissent 2.  But\nthe district court has unequivocally stated that it has not yet completed its work and that\nthe substantial issues raised by the government warrant briefing and a full hearing so\nthat it may render its final judgment.  See Order Denying Stay Mot. 2 (\u201cThere has to be\na hearing, and this Court has to issue an appealable order . . . . The Court respects the\nimportance of the matter and the Article II powers and responsibilities defendants are\nseeking to vindicate, and that is precisely why full briefing and a hearing are required.\u201d). \n\u201cWe are a court of review, not of first view.\u201d  New LifeCare Hosps. of N. Carolina, LLC\nv. Becerra, 7 F.4th 1215, 1225 (D.C. Cir. 2021) (cleaned up).  No matter how strong the\nmerits arguments appear, our job is to wait to address them in the context of reviewing\nthe district court\u2019s ruling on either an appealable preliminary injunction or a final\njudgment on the merits.\nThe government relies on Adams to argue that \u201cthe significance of the harm that\na TRO poses\u201d is a relevant factor in determining a TRO\u2019s appealability.  Stay Mot. 8\u20139. \nThat is true, but the harm that was at issue in Adams is readily distinguishable.  In\nAdams, the International Whaling Commission, an international treaty body, banned\nAlaskan Native hunting of a certain species of whale, subject to the United States\u2019s\nobjection.  See Adams, 570 F.2d at 952.  Four days before the deadline to object,\nplaintiffs, representing a group of Alaskan Natives asserting a right to hunt whales, sued\nthe Secretary of State; and the district court issued a TRO ordering the Secretary to\nobject.  Id.  We held that we had jurisdiction over the government\u2019s appeal.  We\nexplained that \u201cthe order was in purpose and effect a mandatory injunction appealable\nunder 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1)\u201d because \u201c[i]t did not merely preserve the status quo\npending further proceedings, but commanded an unprecedented action irreversibly\naltering the delicate diplomatic balance in the environmental arena.\u201d  Id.  \u201cWhen an\norder directs action so potent with consequences so irretrievable,\u201d we added, \u201cwe\nprovide an immediate appeal to protect the rights of the parties.\u201d  Id. at 953.  We noted\nthat the district court\u2019s order \u201cwas based on the unwarranted assumption that such\nobjection would not harm the United States because the objection could be withdrawn\u201d\nand that this \u201cassumption . . . is an unwarranted intrusion on executive discretion in the\nfield of foreign policy and agreements insofar as it represents a judgment.\u201d  Id. at 952.  \nUnlike the court order in Adams, the district court\u2019s TRO maintains the status quo\nand does not command unprecedented action \u2014 to the contrary, Dellinger has served\nas Special Counsel for nearly a year.  See Huisha-Huisha v. Mayorkas, 27 F.4th 718,\n732 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (noting that in the context of a preliminary injunction, \u201c[t]he status\nquo is the last uncontested status which preceded the pending controversy\u201d (cleaned\nPage 11\n\nUSCA Case #25-5028      Document #2100953            Filed: 02/15/2025      Page 12 of 27\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n____________\nNo. 25-5028 September Term, 2024\nup)).  Nor is the TRO irreversible.  It is in effect only until the preliminary-injunction\nhearing on February 26, 2025, at which point the district court can deny the preliminary\ninjunction and allow the President to remove Dellinger, if the court so chooses. \nMoreover, the court order in Adams \u201cdirect[ed] action by the Secretary of State in\nforeign affairs,\u201d which \u201cplainly\u201d and \u201cdeeply\u201d intruded into \u201cthe core concerns of the\nexecutive branch.\u201d  Adams, 570 F.2d at 954.  Here, by contrast, the asserted harm to\nthe President\u2019s authority is disputed:  Whether the constraint on the President\u2019s removal\nauthority imposed by section 1211(b) is constitutional is still to be litigated on the merits.\nThe government\u2019s remaining argument is that the TRO should be treated as a\npreliminary injunction because \u201cthe district court has now considerably prolonged\n[extraordinary] harm by setting its TRO to last for 14 days, on top of the two-day\nduration of its \u2018administrative stay.\u2019\u201d  Stay Mot. 9.  But the government fails to explain\nwhy the expiration date of the TRO converts the TRO into an injunction.  Rule 65(a)\npermits the district court to set the expiration date of a TRO and specifies that such an\norder may not \u201cexceed 14 days\u201d unless the court, \u201cfor good cause, extends it.\u201d  Fed. R.\nCiv. P. 65(b)(2).  The government does not argue that the TRO\u2019s fourteen-day period is\nlonger than permitted by the Rule, but instead seems to suggest that the harm of\nkeeping a Special Counsel in place against the President\u2019s wishes is so intolerable that\nthe wrong must be corrected immediately.  Fourteen days is not a long time in the realm\nof litigation, and it is a standard period for a TRO to be in effect under Rule 65(b).  The\ngovernment does not meet its burden to show why this factor weighs in favor of finding\nthe TRO appealable.  In sum, the government fails to meet the \u201chigh threshold\u201d for\ndemonstrating that the district court\u2019s TRO should be treated as a preliminary injunction,\nsubject to interlocutory appeal.  See Native Vill. of Chenaga Bay, 1991 WL 40471, at\n*1.2\nIV.\nThe Supreme Court noted in Cheney that, with respect to petitions involving the\nPresident or Vice President, \u201cmandamus standards are broad enough to allow a court\nof appeals to prevent a lower court from interfering with a co-equal branch\u2019s ability to\n2  The government does not rely on any of the other considerations that courts\nhave looked to in determining whether a TRO is appealable:  It has not argued that the\nTRO will foreclose future action for injunctive relief or that it is functionally a preliminary\ninjunction because the district court issued it after a contested hearing.  See Al-Tamimi\nv. Adelson, 916 F.3d 1, 6 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (\u201cA party forfeits an argument by failing to\nraise it in his opening brief.\u201d).\nPage 12\n\nUSCA Case #25-5028      Document #2100953            Filed: 02/15/2025      Page 13 of 27\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n____________\nNo. 25-5028 September Term, 2024\ndischarge its constitutional responsibilities.\u201d  Cheney v.

Thus, a writ of mandamus is the most appropriate relief for the\ngovernment to seek when asserting harms that implicate the separation of powers and\nexecutive authority.  Yet, the government relegates mandamus to a secondary,\nalternative claim, arguing only that if the TRO is unappealable, we should \u201cexercise\n[our] discretion to treat [the stay motion] as a petition for writ of mandamus.\u201d  Stay Mot.\n10.  The government fails to meet the rigorous standard for mandamus relief.    \nAs the Supreme Court has emphasized, a writ of mandamus \u201cis a \u2018drastic and\nextraordinary\u2019 remedy \u2018reserved for really extraordinary causes.\u2019\u201d  Cheney, 542 U.S. at\n380 (quoting Ex parte Fahey, 332 U.S. 258, 259\u201360 (1947)).  \u201c\u2018[T]he writ cannot be\nused to actually control the decision of the trial court,\u2019 because \u2018[a]s an appellate court,\nwe are a court of review, not of first view.\u2019\u201d  Flynn, 973 F.3d at 78 (cleaned up) (first\nquoting Bankers Life & Cas. Co. v. Holland, 346 U.S. 379, 383 (1953); and then Cutter\nv. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718 n.7 (2005)).\nA court should issue a writ of mandamus \u201conly if:  (1) \u2018the party seeking issuance\nof the writ [has] no other adequate means to attain the relief he desires\u2019; (2) \u2018the\npetitioner [satisfies] the burden of showing that his right to issuance of the writ is clear\nand indisputable\u2019; and (3) \u2018the issuing court, in the exercise of its discretion, [is] satisfied\nthat the writ is appropriate under the circumstances.\u2019\u201d  Flynn, 973 F.3d at 78 (quoting\nCheney, 542 U.S. at 380\u201381).  When a case \u201cimplicates the separation of powers, the\nCourt of Appeals must also ask, as part of this inquiry, whether the District Court\u2019s\nactions constituted an unwarranted impairment of another branch in the performance of\nits constitutional duties.\u201d  Cheney, 542 U.S. at 390.  \nThe government fails the Cheney test at every step.  First, the government\nobviously has other adequate means to attain the relief it seeks \u2014 it can attempt to\npersuade the district court to deny the preliminary-injunction motion and allow the\nPresident to remove Dellinger during the pendency of the case; and if the government\nfails in that attempt, it is entitled to appeal the district court\u2019s ruling.  See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\n1292(a)(1).  As noted, the legal standard governing the issuance of preliminary\ninjunctions is identical to that governing the entry of TROs.  Thus, a premature appeal\nof the TRO ruling would unduly impinge on the district court\u2019s ability to resolve the\npreliminary-injunction motion that is presently before it.  In Flynn, we noted that we were\nunaware of any precedent in which \u201cour Court, or any court, issued the writ to compel a\ndistrict court to decide an undecided motion in a particular way \u2014 i.e., when the district\ncourt might yet decide the motion in that way on its own.\u201d  Flynn, 973 F.3d at 79\n(emphasis in original); see also id. at 82 (\u201cTry as they might, neither Petitioner, nor the\nGovernment, nor the dissent has identified a single instance where any court of appeals\nPage 13\n\nUSCA Case #25-5028      Document #2100953            Filed: 02/15/2025      Page 14 of 27\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n____________\nNo. 25-5028 September Term, 2024\nhas granted the writ to decide a trial court motion without first giving the district court an\nopportunity to make a decision.\u201d).  Appellate review after the preliminary-injunction\nproceeding easily safeguards the government\u2019s interests here.  See Roche v.\nEvaporated Milk Ass\u2019n, 319 U.S. 21, 27\u201328 (1943) (\u201cOrdinarily mandamus may not be\nresorted to as a mode of review where a statutory method of appeal has been\nprescribed . . . .\u201d).  \nMoreover, \u201c[w]hen ordinary appellate review (or even, as here, further\nproceedings before the District Court) remains available, the writ may not issue unless\nthe petitioner \u2018identif[ies] some \u2018irreparable\u2019 injury that will go unredressed if he does not\nsecure mandamus relief.\u2019\u201d  Flynn, 973 F.3d at 79 (quoting In re al-Nashiri, 791 F.3d 71,\n79 (D.C. Cir. 2015)).  But the harm alleged by the government is not irreparable\nbecause, as previously discussed, the alleged harm is largely contingent on the\ngovernment prevailing on the merits.  \nSecond, the government has not met its burden to show that its entitlement to\nmandamus is clear and indisputable.  To meet this requirement, the petitioner must\n\u201cpoint to \u2018cases in which a federal court has held that\u2019 relief is warranted \u2018in a matter\ninvolving like issues and comparable circumstances.\u2019\u201d  In re Al Baluchi, 952 F.3d 363,\n369 (D.C. Cir. 2020) (quoting Doe v. Exxon Mobil Corp., 473 F.3d 345, 355 (D.C. Cir.\n2007)).  \u201cAccordingly, we will deny mandamus even if a petitioner\u2019s argument, though\n\u2018pack[ing] substantial force,\u2019 is not clearly mandated by statutory authority or case law.\u201d \nId. (quoting In re Khadr, 823 F.3d 92, 99\u2013100 (D.C. Cir. 2016)).  Indeed, we have\nrecognized that open legal questions do not present a clear and indisputable right to\nmandamus relief.  See Al-Nashiri, 791 F.3d at 85\u201386.  Here, the government states\nonly that \u201cgiven the Supreme Court\u2019s recent decisions in Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220\n(2021), and Seila Law [LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020)], the government\u2019s right to\nissuance of the writ is clear and undisputable.\u201d  Stay Mot. 10 (cleaned up).  But the\ncited cases do not hold that the President has unrestricted power to remove the Special\nCounsel.  Rather, they pertain to the removal of heads of other government agencies. \nSeila Law specifically distinguishes the Office of Special Counsel in its analysis, Seila\nLaw, 591 U.S. at 221, and Collins notes that the Court was \u201cnot comment[ing] on the\nconstitutionality of\u201d the removal restriction for the Office of Special Counsel,  Collins,\n594 U.S. at 256 n.21  Although the government argues that Collins and Seila Law\nsupport its position in this case, Stay Mot. 11\u201321, Dellinger argues that those cases\nactually support his view, Opp\u2019n to Stay Mot. 15\u201320.  Because the extent of the\nPresident\u2019s power to remove the Special Counsel is an open legal question, the\ngovernment\u2019s right to mandamus is not clear and indisputable.    \nPage 14\n\nUSCA Case #25-5028      Document #2100953            Filed: 02/15/2025      Page 15 of 27\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n____________\nNo. 25-5028 September Term, 2024\nFinally, a writ of mandamus is not appropriate under the circumstances\npresented.  This requirement calls for the court to exercise its discretion.  See Cheney,\n542 U.S. at 381 (\u201c[E]ven if the first two prerequisites have been met, the issuing court,\nin the exercise of its discretion, must be satisfied that the writ is appropriate under the\ncircumstances.\u201d); Whitehouse v. Ill. Cent. R.R. Co., 349 U.S. 366, 373 (1955)\n(\u201c[M]andamus is itself governed by equitable considerations and is to be granted only in\nthe exercise of sound discretion.\u201d).  Here, granting the writ would undermine the\nestablished framework for litigating TROs and preliminary injunctions, short-circuit\nongoing proceedings before the district court, and prejudice the orderly administration\nof justice.  It is therefore not appropriate to grant the writ.  \nBecause none of the Cheney considerations are satisfied, we deny the petition\nfor a writ of mandamus.\n***\nFor the foregoing reasons, the appeal is dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, the\nemergency motion for a stay of the TRO is dismissed as moot, and the petition for a\nwrit of mandamus is denied.   \nPursuant to D.C. Circuit Rule 36, this disposition will not be published.  The Clerk\nis directed to withhold issuance of the mandate herein until seven days after resolution\nof any timely petition for rehearing or petition for rehearing en banc.  See Fed. R. App.\nP. 41(b); D.C. Cir. Rule 41.\nPer Curiam\nFOR THE COURT:\nClifton B. Cislak, Clerk \nBY: /s/\nScott H. Atchue\nDeputy Clerk\nPage 15\n\nUSCA Case #25-5028      Document #2100953            Filed: 02/15/2025      Page 16 of 27\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n____________\nNo. 25-5028 September Term, 2024\nKATSAS, Circuit Judge, dissenting:  The President removed Hampton Dellinger\nfrom his position as Special Counsel, the sole head of a federal agency that wields\nexecutive power in prosecuting enforcement actions before the Merit Systems\nProtection Board.  The district court then ordered the President to recognize Dellinger\nas the agency head for two weeks.  Despite the limited duration of that order, I would\nstay it immediately.  As explained below, the President is immune from injunctions\ndirecting the performance of his official duties, and Article II of the Constitution grants\nhim the power to remove agency heads.\nI\nOn Friday, February 7, 2025, President Trump removed Hampton Dellinger from\nhis position as Special Counsel.  On Monday, February 10, Dellinger sued the\nPresident, Secretary of the Treasury, Director of the Office of Personnel Management,\nand other executive-branch officials to challenge the removal decision.  Dellinger\nmoved for a temporary restraining order reinstating him to his post.  That afternoon,\nbefore the government could file an opposition, the district court entered a brief\nadministrative stay that reinstated Dellinger, required the defendants to provide him\naccess to the resources and materials of his former Office, and prohibited the\ndefendants from recognizing any other person as Special Counsel.\nOn Wednesday, February 12, after the government filed its opposition, the\ndistrict court entered a TRO against all defendants extending the relief previously\ngranted.  That is, the district court ordered the President, along with other senior\nexecutive-branch officials, to recognize Dellinger as Special Counsel.  It did so even\nthough the President, pursuant to the Vacancies Reform Act, had already designated\nDoug Collins, the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, as Acting Special Counsel.  The court\nsuggested that the President, in making this designation, had violated its pre-TRO stay\norder.  See Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-0385, 2025 WL 471022, at *14 n.8 (D.D.C.\nFeb. 12, 2025).\nThe district court extensively discussed the four factors governing the issuance\nof TROs and preliminary injunctions.  It found that Dellinger was likely to succeed on\nthe merits of his challenge to the President's removal order, that Dellinger would suffer\nirreparable injury in the absence of an order immediately reinstating him, and that the\nbalance of harms and the public interest favored an order reinstating him as Special\nCounsel and requiring the President to recognize him as such.  See Dellinger, 2025 WL\n471022, at *4-13.  The court set a preliminary-injunction hearing for February 26, and it\nordered the parties to weigh in on whether to (1) treat the TRO briefing as briefing on a\npreliminary-injunction motion and (2) consolidate the preliminary-injunction hearing with\nthe merits.  Id. at *14.\nPage 1\n\nUSCA Case #25-5028      Document #2100953            Filed: 02/15/2025      Page 17 of 27\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n____________\nNo. 25-5028 September Term, 2024\nThe government immediately appealed and sought an emergency stay.  In the\nmeantime, the government requested consolidation in the district court, which Dellinger\ndoes not oppose.  These positions presumably reflect that the questions presented,\nwhich the district court has thoroughly addressed, are purely legal in nature.  And for\nthat reason, they are fit for immediate review.\nII\nCongress established the Office of Special Counsel in the Civil Service Reform\nAct of 1978.  Pub. L. No. 95-454, \u00a7 202, 92 Stat. 1111, 1121 (1978).  The Office is\nheaded by a single individual\u2014the Special Counsel\u2014who is appointed by the President\nand confirmed by the Senate.  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b).  The Special Counsel serves a\nfive-year term, and, under the statute\u2019s terms, may be removed \u201conly for inefficiency,\nneglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d  Id.\nThe Special Counsel has broad investigative and enforcement powers.  He may\n\u201creceive and investigate allegations of prohibited personnel practices\u201d anywhere within\nthe federal government.  5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1212(a)(2), 1214(a)(1)(A).  The list of \u201cprohibited\npersonnel practices\u201d is extensive.  Among other things, it includes\u2014for all past, current,\nor prospective federal employees\u2014allegations of discrimination, unauthorized\nemployment preferences, coerced political activity, retaliation for various protected\nactivities, improper influence, deception, and obstruction.  See id. \u00a7 2302(b); 5 C.F.R.\n\u00a7 1800.2(a).  Additionally, the Special Counsel may investigate alleged violations of the\nHatch Act, the Freedom of Information Act, the Uniformed Services Employment and\nReemployment Rights Act, and more.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1216(a); 5 C.F.R. \u00a7 1800.2(b). \nIn certain circumstances, he may also \u201crequire an agency head to conduct an\ninvestigation and submit a written report.\u201d  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1213(a), (c)(2).  To further\nhis investigations, the Special Counsel may issue subpoenas, order depositions and\ninterrogatories, examine witnesses under oath, and receive evidence.  Id. \u00a7 1212(b). \nDuring an investigation, he must be given access to all relevant agency \u201crecords, data,\nreports, audits, reviews, documents, papers, recommendations, or other material,\u201d id.\n\u00a7 1212(b)(5)(A)(i), and he may \u201crequire\u201d the agency to provide such materials, id.\n\u00a7 1212(b)(5)(A)(iii).\nAfter investigating, the Special Counsel may bring enforcement actions before\nthe MSPB.  To protect employees harmed by prohibited personnel practices, he may\nseek \u201ca stay of any personnel action\u201d or other \u201ccorrective action.\u201d  5 U.S.C.\n\u00a7\u00a7 1214(b)(1)(A)(i), 1214(b)(2)(B).  And to discipline employees who allegedly have\ncommitted prohibited personnel practices or violated the other statutes within his\ninvestigatory jurisdiction, the Special Counsel may \u201cfile a complaint [with the MSPB] or\nPage 2\n\nUSCA Case #25-5028      Document #2100953            Filed: 02/15/2025      Page 18 of 27\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n____________\nNo. 25-5028 September Term, 2024\nmake recommendations for disciplinary action\u201d to the Board, agency heads, or even the\nPresident.  See id. \u00a7\u00a7 1212(a)(2)(B), 1215(a), (b).  The Special Counsel may seek\nsanctions including removal, debarment from federal employment, suspension, and civil\npenalties.  See id. \u00a7 1215(a)(3). \nGiven these powers, our Court has labeled the Special Counsel a\n\u201cprosecutor . . . of merit system abuses,\u201d who pursues \u201ccorrective action petitions\u201d\nbefore the MSPB that are \u201ccomparable to criminal prosecutions designed to vindicate\nthe public interest.\u201d  Frazier v. MSPB, 672 F.2d 150, 163 (D.C. Cir. 1982) (cleaned up);\nsee also Barnhart v. Devine, 771 F.2d 1515, 1520 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (Special Counsel is\n\u201cprosecutorial arm\u201d and MSPB is \u201cadjudicatory apparatus\u201d).  The MSPB likewise has\ndescribed the Special Counsel's relationship to it as like \u201cthat of a prosecuting attorney\nto a court.\u201d  Layser v. USDA, 8 M.S.P.B. 72, 73 (1981).\nIII\nBefore addressing the government\u2019s request for a stay, I must consider this\nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction over the underlying appeal.  That question arises because the\nFebruary 12 order is styled as a TRO and remains effective for only two weeks.  As a\ngeneral matter, TROs are not appealable.  But in my view, this TRO\u2014which orders the\nPresident to recognize the authority of an agency head whom he has formally\nremoved\u2014qualifies for immediate review.\nA\nAlthough orders granting preliminary injunctions are appealable, 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1292(a)(1), TROs generally are not.  See Adams v. Vance, 570 F.2d 950, 953 (D.C.\nCir. 1978); 16 C. Wright, A. Miller & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure\n\u00a7 3922.1 (3d ed.) (Wright & Miller).  Courts have offered a practical justification for this\nrule:  Because TROs are of \u201cbrief duration\u201d and designed only \u201cto preserve the\nopportunity to rule in orderly fashion upon a request for longer-lasting preliminary relief,\u201d\nthey ordinarily do \u201cnot threaten irreparable injury.\u201d  Wright & Miller, \u00a7 3922.1.  But some\nTROs do threaten immediate irreparable injuries, no matter how short their duration. \nSo, the rule against appealability is flexible; it gives way \u201con finding that in the\ncircumstances of a particular case the need for immediate appeal overcomes the\nreasons for the general rule that appeal is not available.\u201d  Id.; see Ne. Ohio Coal. for\nHomeless & Serv. Emps. Int\u2019l Union, Loc. 1199 v. Blackwell, 467 F.3d 999, 1005 (6th\nCir. 2006) (courts look \u201cto the nature of the order and the substance of the proceeding\nbelow to determine whether the rationale for denying appeal applies\u201d).  For example, in\nAdams, to protect the Executive Branch from \u201cirretrievable\u201d consequences, this Court\nPage 3\n\nUSCA Case #25-5028      Document #2100953            Filed: 02/15/2025      Page 19 of 27\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n____________\nNo. 25-5028 September Term, 2024\nreviewed and reversed a TRO directing the Secretary of State to object to an\ninternational whaling ban just before an impending deadline.  See 570 F.2d at 953-57. \nIn Northeast Ohio Coalition, the Sixth Circuit, to prevent \u201cirretrievable harm on the State\nof Ohio,\u201d reviewed and reversed a TRO enjoining enforcement of its voter-identification\nlaw on the eve of an election.  467 F.3d at 1006.  And in Hope v. Warden York County\nPrison, 956 F.3d 156 (3d Cir. 2020), the Third Circuit, to prevent \u201cirreversible\u201d harm to a\ncounty in Eastern Pennsylvania, reviewed a TRO compelling state officials to\nimmediately release certain immigration detainees because of the COVID pandemic. \nId. at 160-62 (citing Adams, 570 F.2d at 953).\nB\nThe extraordinary character of the order at issue here\u2014which directs the\nPresident to recognize and work with an agency head whom he has already\nremoved\u2014warrants immediate appellate review.\nWhen it comes to judicial review, courts have long recognized the \u201cspecial status\nof the President.\u201d  Chamber of Com. v. Reich, 74 F.3d 1322, 1331 n.4 (D.C. Cir. 1996)\n(citations omitted).  While the President is not absolutely immune from judicial process,\nit is \u201cobvious\u201d that a court may not \u201cproceed against the president as against an\nordinary individual.\u201d  United States v. Burr, 25 F. Cas. 187, 192 (C.C.D. Va. 1807)\n(Marshall, C.J.).  Indeed, the prospect of judicial encroachment on presidential authority\ninforms various facets of separation-of-powers jurisprudence.  For instance, the\nPresident enjoys unique evidentiary privileges, United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683,\n707-09 (1974); absolute immunity from damages suits for official acts, Nixon v.\nFitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731, 749 (1982); and at least presumptive immunity from criminal\nprosecution for official acts, Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593, 614 (2024). \nSolicitude for the President also informs various doctrines regarding immediate\nappellate review.  For example, in United States v. Nixon, the Supreme Court held that\nan order compelling the President to produce subpoenaed documents in a pending\ncriminal case was a \u201cfinal\u201d decision supporting an immediate appeal under 28 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1291\u2014even though any other party would have had to defy the order and go into\ncontempt to obtain review.  See 418 U.S. at 690-92.  In Cheney v. United States District\nCourt for the District of Columbia, 542 U.S. 367 (2004), the Supreme Court allowed the\nVice President to seek immediate review of discovery orders entered against him in a\npending civil case.  Id. at 378.  The Vice President alleged \u201csubstantial intrusions on the\nprocess by which those in closest operational proximity to the President advise the\nPresident.\u201d  Id. at 381 (cleaned up).  The Court agreed, explaining that the allegations\n\u201cremove[d] this case from the category of ordinary discovery orders where interlocutory\nPage 4\n\nUSCA Case #25-5028      Document #2100953            Filed: 02/15/2025      Page 20 of 27\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n____________\nNo. 25-5028 September Term, 2024\nappellate review is unavailable.\u201d  Id.  For petitions \u201cinvolving the President or Vice\nPresident,\u201d it held that \u201cmandamus standards are broad enough to allow a court of\nappeals to prevent a lower court from interfering with a coequal branch's ability to\ndischarge its constitutional responsibilities.\u201d  Id. at 382.  And it vacated the discovery\norders based on the same considerations.  See id. at 383-92.  Finally, even apart from\nany question of immunity, the President may immediately appeal any interlocutory order\nrejecting an as-applied defense under Article II of the Constitution to a criminal\nprosecution.  See Trump, 603 U.S. at 654 (Barrett, J., concurring).  These decisions\nreflect a common theme:  Where a lower court allegedly impinges on the President's\ncore Article II powers, immediate appellate review should be generally available.  The\nbalancing of interests to determine appealability under Adams is flexible enough to\naccommodate the same outcome here.\nImmunity considerations reinforce this conclusion.  When a district court denies a\nclaim of presidential immunity, the President may seek immediate review, see Trump,\n603 U.S. at 606; Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. at 741, just like any other official or\nsovereign seeking to vindicate an asserted litigation immunity, see Puerto Rico\nAqueduct & Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S. 139, 142-47 (1993); Mitchell\nv. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526 (1985).  And the President enjoys absolute immunity from\ninjunctive actions.  In Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788 (1992), the Supreme\nCourt reiterated long-settled law that the federal courts have \u201cno jurisdiction of a bill to\nenjoin the President in the performance of his official duties.\u201d  Id. at 802-03 (plurality\nop.) (quoting Mississippi v. Johnson, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 475, 501 (1867)); see also id. at\n827 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (same); Newdow v.\nRoberts, 603 F.3d 1002, 1013 (D.C. Cir. 2010) (\u201cWith regard to the President, courts do\nnot have jurisdiction to enjoin him.\u201d (cleaned up)).  Franklin, Mississippi, and Newdow\nall phrased the President's absolute protection from injunctive actions as a jurisdictional\nbar, but it is one that restrains the Judiciary in order to protect the President.  So the\njurisdictional bar must also reflect an immunity from litigation burdens, just like the\nPresident's protections from criminal prosecution and civil damages actions.  And the\nimmunity extends, at a minimum, to all official acts that are not \u201cpurely \u2018ministerial.\u2019\u201d \nFranklin, 505 U.S. at 802 (quoting Mississippi, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) at 498-99); see also id.\nat 826 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (\u201cI think it clear that\nno court has authority to direct the President to take an official act.\u201d).1\n1  I do not suggest that insubstantial assertions of immunity would trigger a right\nto immediate appellate review.  They would not.  See Process & Indus. Devs., Ltd. v.\nFederal Republic of Nigeria, 962 F.3d 576, 583 (D.C. Cir. 2020).  Likewise, the Adams\ninquiry is flexible enough to exclude insubstantial assertions.  But here, as explained\nPage 5\n\nUSCA Case #25-5028      Document #2100953            Filed: 02/15/2025      Page 21 of 27\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n____________\nNo. 25-5028 September Term, 2024\nThe order here is immediately reviewable under these principles.  It purports to\nenjoin the President\u2019s removal of an agency head.  Yet the \u201cPresident\u2019s removal power\nserves vital purposes\u201d; it \u201chelps the President maintain a degree of control over the\nsubordinates he needs to carry out his duties as the head of the Executive Branch, and\nit works to ensure that these subordinates serve the people effectively.\u201d  Collins v.\nYellen, 594 U.S. 220, 252 (2021).  The removal power \u201cis in no just sense ministerial,\u201d\nbut instead \u201cis purely executive and political.\u201d  Mississippi, 71 U.S. at 499; see In re\nHennen, 38 U.S. 230, 259-60 (1839).  So the order ran afoul of Mississippi v. Johnson,\nand it usurped a core Article II power of the President.  It is thus immediately\nappealable.2 \nC\nAgainst all of this, Dellinger contends that we lack jurisdiction because the TRO\nmerely preserves the status quo, defined as the last uncontested status just before the\ncontroversy arose.  Our precedents do take that consideration into account, in\nassessing both irreparable injury, see Huisha-Huisha v. Mayorkas, 27 F.4th 718,\n733-34 (D.C. Cir. 2022), and appealability, see Adams, 570 F.2d at 953.  But it does not\nalways carry the day.  As explained above, TROs themselves sometimes inflict\nirreparable injury, and in those cases an immediate appeal is available to avoid it.  For\ninstance, the last uncontested status in Northeast Ohio Coalition was the world with no\nvoter ID law, and the TRO at issue preserved that status.  See 467 F.3d at 1006. \nNonetheless, because the TRO unjustifiably inflicted irreparable harm on Ohio, the\nSixth Circuit reviewed and reversed it.  See id.  The appealability inquiry thus ultimately\nturns less on trying to define the most relevant status quo, or trying to characterize the\ninjunction as mandatory or prohibitory, than it does on a \u201cweighing of relative\nhardships.\u201d  Wright & Miller, \u00a7 3922.1; cf. Labrador v. Poe ex rel. Poe, 144 S. Ct. 921,\n930-31 (2024) (Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (\u201cdifficulties emerge when trying to define\nbelow, the asserted immunity is more than colorable.\n2  My colleagues seek to cure the Mississippi v. Johnson problem by excluding\nthe President from the scope of the TRO.  Ante at 10 n.1.  But by its terms, the order\nexpressly applies to all \u201cDefendants.\u201d  See Dellinger, 2025 WL 471022, at *14. \nMoreover, the district court observed that the designation of Secretary Collins as the\nActing Special Counsel\u2014which only the President could do\u2014\u201cmay have\u201d violated the\nterms of its initial order.  Id. at *14 n.8.  And the TRO necessarily targets the\nPresident\u2014the only official with the statutory and constitutional authority to appoint,\nremove, and supervise the Special Counsel.\nPage 6\n\nUSCA Case #25-5028      Document #2100953            Filed: 02/15/2025      Page 22 of 27\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n____________\nNo. 25-5028 September Term, 2024\nthe status quo,\u201d depending on whether the challenged conduct or the injunction of it is\nmore injurious).  Here, though the two-week timeframe mitigates some harms on both\nsides of the balance, the weighing still tips decidedly in favor of the government.  As\nexplained more fully below, the TRO unjustifiably intrudes into a core institutional\nprerogative of the President, while Dellinger's modest individual injury could be\nremedied in an action for backpay. \nFor these reasons, the TRO is immediately appealable.\nIV\nThe government asks us to stay the TRO pending our resolution of the appeal. \nFour considerations are relevant: whether (1) the government has made a strong\nshowing that it will prevail on appeal; (2) the government will be irreparably harmed\nabsent a stay; (3) issuance of the stay will substantially harm Dellinger or others; and\n(4) the stay is in the public interest.  Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 425-26 (2009)\n(citation omitted).  Applying these factors, I would grant a stay.\nA\nThe government has shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits.  An\ninjunction preventing the President from firing an agency head\u2014and thus controlling\nhow he performs his official duties\u2014is virtually unheard of.  See Franklin, 505 U.S. at\n827 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment) (\u201cI am aware of only\none instance in which we were specifically asked to issue an injunction requiring the\nPresident to take specified executive acts [and] we emphatically disclaimed the\nauthority to do so\u201d).  And in any event, Article II of the Constitution empowers the\nPresident \u201cto remove the head of an agency with a single top officer.\u201d  Collins, 594 U.S.\nat 256.\n1\nTo begin with, Dellinger cannot overcome various barriers to injunctive relief\nhere.  Most obviously, courts may not enjoin the President regarding the performance of\nhis official acts, regarding removal or otherwise.  See Franklin, 505 U.S. at 802-03\n(plurality); id. at 827 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and concurring in the judgment);\nMississippi, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) at 501; Newdow, 603 F.3d at 1013.  That is why removed\nexecutive officers traditionally have sought judicial review not through injunctive actions\nagainst the President for reinstatement, but through backpay actions for damages. \nSee, e.g., Weiner v. United States, 357 U.S. 349, 349-51 (1958); Humphrey\u2019s Ex\u2019r v.\nPage 7\n\nUSCA Case #25-5028      Document #2100953            Filed: 02/15/2025      Page 23 of 27\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n____________\nNo. 25-5028 September Term, 2024\nUnited States, 295 U.S. 602, 622 (1935); Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, 106\n(1926).  Perhaps it is also why the parties have identified just a single, unpublished\ndistrict-court decision purporting to enjoin the President from removing any government\nofficial from office.  See Berry v. Reagan, No. 83-3182, 1983 WL 538 (D.D.C. Nov. 14,\n1983).  And even Berry was a far cry from this case:  It involved members of the United\nStates Commission on Civil Rights, a temporary, multi-member agency charged with\nmaking reports to the President and Congress.  The Commission thus had no coercive\npower beyond the ability to issue subpoenas.  See id. at *1.  So while the Berry court\nwrongly enjoined the President, it at least did not impair his ability to remove\u2014and\ntherefore supervise\u2014subordinates wielding his power to faithfully execute federal law.\nMoreover, even when not directed against the President, injunctions in federal\npersonnel matters are highly disfavored.  Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 83-84\n(1974).  The Supreme Court has long warned that judicial interference in government\nhiring and firing \u201cwould lead to the utmost confusion in the management of executive\naffairs,\u201d White v. Berry, 171 U.S. 366, 378 (1898), like the ongoing judicial and\nexecutive dispute over who is currently Special Counsel, see Dellinger, 2025 WL\n471022, at *14 n.8.  Even when seeking an \u201corthodox\u201d injunction regarding federal\npersonnel matters, a plaintiff must make a rigorous showing that he is entitled to relief. \nSampson, 415 U.S. at 84.  And here, the relief Dellinger seeks\u2014an injunction restricting\nthe President\u2019s exercise of his \u201cconclusive and preclusive constitutional authority\u201d to\nremove officers, Trump, 603 U.S. at 608-09\u2014is anything but \u201corthodox.\u201d  To obtain any\ninjunction that so \u201cdeeply intrudes into the core concerns of the executive branch,\u201d\nDellinger must at a minimum \u201cmake an extraordinarily strong showing\u201d that he deserves\nrelief.  Adams, 570 F.2d at 954-55.  As explained below, he cannot.\n2\nThe order at issue rests on statutory removal protections that violate Article II of\nthe Constitution, which vests \u201c[t]he executive [p]ower\u201d in the President and charges him\nwith the faithful execution of the laws.  U.S. Const. Art. II, \u00a7\u00a7 1, 3.  As the Supreme\nCourt has long recognized, these provisions confer upon the President the power to\nremove executive officers at will.  See, e.g., Collins, 594 U.S. at 250-51; Seila Law LLC\nv. CFPB, 591 U.S. 207, 213-15 (2020); Free Enter. Fund v. PCAOB, 561 U.S. 477,\n492-93 (2010); Myers, 272 U.S. at 108-17. \nThe Supreme Court has recently clarified the scope of this removal power. \nConsistent with history and tradition, the President is constitutionally empowered to\n\u201cremove the agents who wield executive power.\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 238; see Free\nEnter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 513-14 (President has \u201cauthority to remove those who assist\nPage 8\n\nUSCA Case #25-5028      Document #2100953            Filed: 02/15/2025      Page 24 of 27\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n____________\nNo. 25-5028 September Term, 2024\nhim in carrying out his duties\u201d).  Congress may restrict that power only in \u201ctwo limited\nexceptions.\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 228.  The first exception, established in\nHumphrey\u2019s Executor, applies to officers who are part of a \u201cmultimember body of\nexperts, balanced along partisan lines, that perform[s] legislative and judicial functions\nand [does not] exercise any executive power.\u201d  Id. at 216.  The second applies to\n\u201cinferior officers with limited duties and no policymaking or administrative authority.\u201d  Id.\nat 218.  These two exceptions represent the \u201coutermost constitutional limits of\npermissible congressional restrictions on the President\u2019s removal power.\u201d  Id. (quoting\nPHH Corp. v. CFPB, 881 F.3d 75, 196 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting)).  In\nrecent decades, the Court has consistently declined to extend these exceptions or\ncreate new ones.  See Collins, 594 U.S. at 250-51; Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 220; Free\nEnter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 483-84.  And twice in the past five years, the Court has held\nthat Congress may not exempt \u201can agency led by a single director\u201d from the President\u2019s\nat-will removal power.  Collins, 594 U.S. at 251; Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 204.\nUnder these rules, Congress cannot constitutionally restrict the President\u2019s\npower to remove the Special Counsel.  First, the Special Counsel undoubtedly wields\nexecutive power.  As described above, he may investigate all manner of prohibited\npersonnel practices and other acts proscribed by specified federal statute.  He may\ndemand from other agencies any records related to one of his investigations.  He may\nsometimes command other agency heads to conduct investigations.  And most\nobviously, he may prosecute actions before the MSPB for various forms of corrective\naction or sanctions.  Based on these powers, we repeatedly have recognized that the\nSpecial Counsel resembles an intra-governmental investigator and prosecutor.  See,\ne.g., Barnhart, 711 F.2d at 1525; Frazier, 672 F.2d at 163.  And prosecutors\nindisputably wield core executive power.  Cmty. for Creative Non-Violence v. Pierce,\n786 F.2d 1199, 1201 (D.C. Cir. 1986).\nSecond, neither of the exceptions to the President\u2019s Article II removal power\napplies here.  The Special Counsel is a single agency head, not a multimember\ncommission, so the Humphrey\u2019s Executor exception does not apply.  And the Special\nCounsel is not an inferior officer\u2014one who is \u201cdirected and supervised at some level by\nothers who were appointed by Presidential nomination with the advice and consent of\nthe Senate.\u201d  United States v. Arthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. 1, 13 (2021); see Edmond v.\nUnited States, 520 U.S. 651, 663-65 (1997).  As the sole head of an agency, he reports\nonly to the President.  And by statute, only the President may remove him.  5 U.S.C.\n\u00a7 1211.\nThe district court reasoned that Seila Law and Collins do not control because the\nSpecial Counsel exercises less executive power than the specific agency heads at\nPage 9\n\nUSCA Case #25-5028      Document #2100953            Filed: 02/15/2025      Page 25 of 27\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n____________\nNo. 25-5028 September Term, 2024\nissue in those cases.  Perhaps so, but both cases held that the President must be able\nto remove\u2014and thus \u201cmaintain a degree of control over\u201d\u2014subordinates through whom\nhe exercises his executive power.  Collins, 594 U.S. at 252; see Seila Law, 591 U.S. at\n204 (\u201cThe President\u2019s power to remove\u2014and thus supervise\u2014those who wield\nexecutive power on his behalf follows from the text of Article II, was settled by the First\nCongress, and was confirmed in the landmark decision in Myers . . . .\u201d).  And although\nthe Court described the Special Counsel\u2019s jurisdiction as more \u201climited\u201d than that of the\nCFPB, it also noted that the Office of Special Counsel is a relatively new creation\nwhose constitutionality has been questioned since its inception.  See Seila Law, 591\nU.S. at 221.  In any event, one year later, Collins held that the constitutionality of a\nremoval restriction does not \u201chinge[]\u201d on \u201cthe relative importance of the regulatory and\nenforcement authority of disparate agencies\u201d that wield executive power.  See 594 U.S.\nat 251-53.  Thus, the Special Counsel\u2019s relatively limited executive functions do not\ndistinguish Seila Law or Collins.\nB\nThe remaining factors also counsel in favor of a stay.\nIrreparable Injury.  The injunction directs the President to recognize and work\nwith an agency head whom he has already removed.  In so doing, it impinges on the\n\u201cconclusive and preclusive\u201d power through which the President controls the Executive\nBranch that he is responsible for supervising.  Trump, 603 U.S. at 608-09; see also The\nFederalist No. 70, at 424 (A. Hamilton) (C. Rossiter ed. 1961) (presidential supervision\nof the Executive Branch ensures \u201ca due dependence on the people\u201d and \u201ca due\nresponsibility\u201d to them).  If the district court had enjoined the removal of the Secretary of\nState, the grave and irreparable character of injury to the President would be apparent. \nCf. Adams, 570 F.2d at 954 (stating that even \u201cdirecting action by the Secretary of State\nin foreign affairs\u201d constitutes an irreversible \u201cintrusion\u201d on \u201cthe core concerns of the\nexecutive branch\u201d).  And while the Special Counsel may be less prominent than the\nSecretary of State, that difference goes to the extent\u2014not the character\u2014of the\nPresident\u2019s injury.  So too does the order\u2019s brief, two-week duration, which mitigates the\nextent\u2014not the character\u2014of harms to both the President and Dellinger.\nIn a much less fraught context, the Supreme Court in Sampson stressed the\nharm to the government from court-ordered reinstatement of terminated government\nemployees.  The Court held that a district court, in considering any such order, \u201cis\nbound to give serious weight to the obviously disruptive effect\u201d that a grant of even\n\u201ctemporary relief\u201d would be \u201clikely to have\u201d on the government\u2019s management of its\ninternal affairs.  415 U.S. at 83.  And that case merely involved a probationary analyst in\nPage 10\n\nUSCA Case #25-5028      Document #2100953            Filed: 02/15/2025      Page 26 of 27\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n____________\nNo. 25-5028 September Term, 2024\nthe General Services Administration\u2019s Public Buildings Service.  Id. at 62.  If ordering\nthe reinstatement of that employee harmed the government enough to raise an\neyebrow, how much more concerning is an order preventing the President from\nremoving, and compelling the President to supervise, an unwanted principal officer?\nFinally, given the clarity of Seila Law and Collins on the constitutional question,\nthe district court's injunction will likely expose the Office of Special Counsel to\nuncertainty and litigation.  Individuals prosecuted by Dellinger in the MSPB inevitably\nwill claim that because he now \u201clack[s] constitutional authority\u201d to serve as the Special\nCounsel, his current governmental acts are \u201cvoid ab initio.\u201d  Collins, 594 U.S. at 257. \nEven if the OSC ultimately prevails on those issues, the claims will create risk and\ndistraction.  And if it does not, every action taken by the Special Counsel during the\npendency of the district court\u2019s TRO could be vulnerable to legal challenge.  While my\ncolleagues correctly note that fourteen days is relatively brief \u201cin the realm of litigation,\u201d\nante at 12, the same cannot be said for the Executive Branch, see, e.g., Seila Law, 591\nU.S. at 223-25; The Federalist No. 70 (A. Hamilton) (discussing the need for an\nenergetic Executive).\nInjury to Dellinger and others.  Granting a stay would not substantially harm\nDellinger.  In Sampson, the Supreme Court held that removal from federal office does\nnot warrant injunctive relief so long as statutory backpay remedies are available.  415\nU.S. at 90-92.  Here, the Back Pay Act would provide Dellinger a remedy in the unlikely\nevent that his challenge were to succeed on the merits.  An officer is eligible for back\npay if he was (1) a civil service officer appointed by the President, (2) engaged in\nperforming a federal function authorized by law, and (3) subject to supervision by the\nPresident.  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2105(a); see Lambert v. United States, 4 Cl. Ct. 303, 305 (1984),\naff'd, 746 F.2d 1490 (Fed. Cir. 1984).  Dellinger checks all three boxes.  First, he was a\npresidential appointee, and the \u201ccivil service\u201d includes all appointive positions in the\nExecutive Branch except for the uniformed service.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 2101(1).  Second,\nhe was engaged in federal statutory functions.  Third, like all principal officers, he was\nsubject to presidential supervision.  Because Dellinger would qualify for backpay if he\nwere to prevail on the merits, he is disqualified from preliminary injunctive relief.\nThe district court focused on Dellinger\u2019s asserted statutory entitlement to serve\nout his term, regardless of any compensation.  But with scant likelihood of success, it\ndoes not count for much.  Moreover, the district court derived that asserted harm from\nthe unpublished Berry decision, which reasoned that the plaintiffs\u2019 \u201cdeprivation of their\nstatutory right to function as Commissioners\u201d would cause institutional injury in the form\nof disrupting proceedings of the Civil Rights Commission.  See 1983 WL 538, at *5.  But\nin Berry, the challenged removals deprived the Commission of a quorum and thus\nPage 11\n\nUSCA Case #25-5028      Document #2100953            Filed: 02/15/2025      Page 27 of 27\nUnited States Court of Appeals\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT\n____________\nNo. 25-5028 September Term, 2024\ndisabled it from functioning at all.  Id.  Here, in contrast, Dellinger\u2019s removal created a\nsingle vacancy, and the President immediately designated an Acting Special Counsel,\nas allowed by the Vacancies Reform Act, until a successor could be nominated,\nconfirmed, and appointed.  There is no reason to think that routine succession would\ntend to destabilize the OSC.  To the contrary, turnover among agency heads is routine. \nAnd over the last few decades, Executive Departments have had almost as many\nacting heads as they have Senate-confirmed ones.  O\u2019Connell, Actings, 120 Colum. L.\nRev. 613, 642 (2020).\nPublic Interest.  A stay is also in the public interest.  \u201cOnly the President (along\nwith the Vice President) is elected by the entire Nation.\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 224. \nSo, only through the President can the Executive Branch and its millions of personnel\nbe held democratically accountable.  Allowing another branch of government to insulate\nexecutive officers from presidential control\u2014whether by congressional statute or judicial\ninjunction\u2014would sever a key constitutional link between the People and their\ngovernment.\nV\nFor these reasons, I would grant the government\u2019s stay motion.  As my\ncolleagues dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, I respectfully dissent.\nPage 12\n\nClearinghouse file: https://clearinghouse-umich-production.s3.amazonaws.com/media/doc/155517.pdf\nExternal link: https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69636261/01208711227/hampton-dellinger-v-scott-bessent/\nClearinghouse summary: clearinghouse.net/doc/155517"

In support of this motion, Hampton Dellinger states as \nfollows: \n1.  On March 3, 2025, defendants-appellants filed a notice of appeal in this \nCourt seeking review of an order issued by the District Court of the District of \nColumbia: Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25 Civ. 385 (D.D.C. March 1, 2025), ECF 33. \nThis Court docketed the appeal as case number 25-5052. Defendants-appellants filed \nan emergency motion for a stay pending appeal that same day. On March 5, 2025, \nHampton Dellinger filed an opposition to the emergency motion for a stay pending \nappeal. Dellinger v. Bessent, 25-5052 (March 5, 2025), ECF 16.  \n2.  In  a  per  curiam  order,  this  Court  granted  defendants-appellants\u2019 \nemergency motion for a stay pending appeal. Dellinger v. Bessent, 25-5052 (March \n5, 2025), ECF 23. The order \u201cgives effect to the removal of appellee from his \nposition as Special Counsel of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel.\u201d Id. at 1. \n3.  \u201cArticle III, Section 2 of the Constitution permits federal courts to \nadjudicate only actual, ongoing controversies.\u201d United States v.

This Court cannot decide a \ncase if \u201cevents have so transpired that the decision will neither presently affect the \nparties\u2019 rights nor have a more-than-speculative chance of affecting them in the \nfuture.\u201d Id. Accordingly, this Court \u201cmust dismiss the case if an event occurs while \n1 \n \n\n \na case is pending on appeal that makes it impossible for the court to grant any \neffectual relief whatever to a prevailing party.\u201d Id. (quotation marks omitted). \n4.  Having  been  removed  from  office,  Hampton  Dellinger  no  longer \nwishes to pursue a judicial remedy to ensure that he remains as Special Counsel. \nBecause Special Counsel Dellinger no longer contests his removal and is out of \noffice, neither this Court nor the district court can afford the government (or Mr. \nDellinger) any relief. The case is now moot and the appeal should be dismissed. \n5.  \u201cWhen  a  case  becomes  moot  on  appeal  ...  this  [C]ourt  generally \nvacates the District Court\u2019s judgment, vacates any outstanding panel decisions, and \nremands to the District Court with direction to dismiss.\u201d United States v. Schaffer, \n240 F.3d 35, 38 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (per curiam); see also, e.g., Clarke v. United States, \n915 F.2d 699, 708 (D.C. Cir. 1990) (en banc) (vacating a panel\u2019s disposition of a \nclaim that had subsequently become moot after a petition for rehearing and rehearing \nen banc had been denied but before the mandate issued); Hirschfeld v. Bureau of \nAlcohol, Firearms, Tobacco & Explosives, 14 F.4th 322, 327 (4th Cir. 2021) (\u201cAs \nthe case is moot and must be dismissed, the government asks that we also vacate \nboth the panel opinions and district court opinions. This is indeed our customary \npractice.\u201d). Special Counsel Dellinger respectfully states that this result is warranted \nhere. The Court should vacate the per curiam order dated March 5, 2025, vacate the \n2 \n \n\n \ndistrict court\u2019s memorandum opinion & order and judgment dated March 1, 2025, \nand remand with direction to dismiss. \n6.

Cislak, Clerk \nBY: /s/\nDaniel J. Reidy \nDeputy Clerk\n\nPER CURIAM:  This case is about the presidential removal power.  After being fired by \nPresident Donald Trump, the Special Counsel, Hampton Dellinger, sued to challenge that action.  \nThe court below granted summary judgment to Dellinger and issued a permanent injunction and \ndeclaratory judgment in his favor.  The government now appeals that decision, requesting a stay \npending appeal.  Because the government has shown a strong likelihood of success on the merits \nand its asserted injury outweighs Dellinger\u2019s, we grant its motion. \nI. \nThe Congress created the Office of the Special Counsel (OSC) in the Civil Service Reform \nAct of 1978.  Pub. L. No. 95-454, \u00a7 202, 92 Stat. 1111, 1121 (1978).  OSC is led by a single \nindividual\u2014the Special Counsel\u2014who is appointed by the President with Senate advice and \nconsent for a five-year term.  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211.  By statute, the Special Counsel may be removed \n\u201conly for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d  Id. \nOSC\u2019s mission is to \u201cprotect employees, former employees, and applicants for employment \nfrom prohibited personnel practices.\u201d  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1212(a)(1); see also Dellinger v. Bessent, --- \nF.Supp.3d ---, 2025 WL 665041, at *4\u201310 (D.D.C. Mar. 1, 2025) (Dellinger I) (detailing OSC\u2019s \nlegislative history).  To achieve that mission, OSC has \u201cinvestigative and enforcement powers.\u201d  \nDellinger v. Bessent, 2025 WL 559669, at *11 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 15, 2025) (Dellinger II) (Katsas, J., \ndissenting).   These  powers  include  the  authority  to  \u201creceive  and  investigate  allegations  of \nprohibited personnel practices\u201d; to \u201cinvestigate alleged violations\u201d of certain other laws; to require \nother agencies to conduct investigations, provide records and submit reports; and to seek stays of \npersonnel actions and file complaints before the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB).  See id. \n(quoting 5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1212\u20131216); Dellinger I, 2025 WL 665041, at *10\u201312 (describing OSC\u2019s \nauthorities). \n\n2 \n \nWhen it was established, OSC was part of the MSPB, which is a \u201c\u2018quasi-judicial body[] \nempowered to determine when abuses or violations of law have occurred\u2019 and to \u2018order corrective \naction.\u2019\u201d  Dellinger I, 2025 WL 665041, at *6 (quoting S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 2 (1978)).  Just over \nten years later, OSC was carved out of the MSPB to become an independent agency.  See id. at *8 \n(citing Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, Pub. L. 101-12, 103 Stat. 16 (1989)).  From the \nbeginning, the Special Counsel had for-cause removal protections.  Civil Service Reform Act, 92 \nStat  at  1122.    The  Office  of  Legal  Counsel  (OLC)  contemporaneously  objected  to  those \nprotections, opining that the Congress could not limit the President\u2019s power to remove the Special \nCounsel because his functions were \u201cexecutive in character\u201d and his \u201crole in investigating and \nprosecuting prohibited practices\u201d was analogous to \u201cthat of a U.S. attorney.\u201d  Id. at *7 (quoting \nMem. Op. for the Gen. Couns., Civ. Serv. Comm\u2019n, 2 Op. O.L.C. 120, 120 (1978)); see also \nDellinger II, 2025 WL 559669, at *11 (collecting authorities referring to the Special Counsel as a \nprosecutor).  Presidents Ronald Reagan and Trump also expressed constitutional concerns about \nthe for-cause removal protections.  Dellinger I, 2025 WL 665041, at *8, 10. \nPresident Joe Biden nominated Dellinger to be Special Counsel on October 3, 2023 and he \nwas sworn into office on March 6, 2024 after being confirmed by the Senate.  On February 7, 2025, \nPresident Trump fired Dellinger, effective immediately.  Dellinger then sued President Trump and \nother executive-branch officials in district court, seeking a declaratory judgment that the firing was \nunlawful and an injunction against the other officials to prevent them from removing him from \noffice.  The court granted Dellinger injunctive and declaratory relief on March 1, 2025 and this \nappeal followed. \n\n3 \n \nII. \nIn deciding whether to grant a stay, we consider: \u201c(1) whether the stay applicant has made a \nstrong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be \nirreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other \nparties interested in the proceeding; and (4) where the public interest lies.\u201d  Nken v. Holder, 556 \nU.S. 418, 434 (2009).  \u201cThe first two factors . . . are the most critical.\u201d  See id. at 434. \nA. \nOn the first factor, the government has satisfied its burden.  \u201c[T]he Constitution prohibits even \n\u2018modest restrictions\u2019 on the President\u2019s power to remove the head of an agency with a single top \nofficer.\u201d  Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220, 256 (2021) (quoting Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. \n197, 228 (2020)); see also Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593, 621 (2024) (\u201c[T]he President\u2019s \npower to remove \u2018executive officers of the United States whom he has appointed\u2019 may not be \nregulated by Congress or reviewed by the courts.\u201d) (quoting Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, \n106, 176 (1926)).  Granted, Seila Law noted the more \u201climited jurisdiction\u201d of OSC as compared \nto the agency at issue there, Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 221, and Collins did \u201cnot comment on the \nconstitutionality of any removal restriction that applies to [the Special Counsel],\u201d 594 U.S. at 256 \nn.21.  However, the government has shown that the logic of those cases is substantially likely to \nextend to the Special Counsel. \nThat is so because the Court in Collins clarified that \u201c[c]ourts are not well-suited to weigh the \nrelative importance of the regulatory and enforcement authority of disparate agencies\u201d and so it \ndid \u201cnot think that the constitutionality of removal restrictions hinges on such an inquiry.\u201d  Id. at \n253.  This case illustrates the point.  Compare Dellinger II, 2025 WL 559669, at *11 (Katsas, J., \ndissenting) (\u201cThe Special Counsel has broad investigative and enforcement powers.\u201d) and Mot. 14 \n\n4 \n \n(describing OSC\u2019s powers as \u201csignificant\u201d) with Dellinger I, 2025 WL 665041, at *20 (\u201cOSC [is] \nnot . . . vested with significant executive power.\u201d) and Opp\u2019n 9 (describing OSC\u2019s powers as \n\u201cextremely limited\u201d).  Nevertheless, such parsing of authorities is precisely the inquiry that the \ndistrict court engaged in below and that Dellinger asks us to undertake now.  Dellinger I, 2025 WL \n665041, at *16\u201328; Opp\u2019n 6\u201313.  Accordingly, the government is likely to succeed in showing that \narguments about the scope and functions of the Special Counsel as a sole agency head do not affect \nthe President\u2019s removal power. \nBoth the district court and Dellinger highlight that Seila Law was particularly concerned about \nthe \u201csignificant executive power\u201d that the director there wielded.  Dellinger I, 2025 WL 665041, \nat *19, 20 (quoting Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 220); Opp\u2019n 8 (same).  The district court reformulated \nthe removal test as whether an agency can \u201cfairly be likened to a typical administrative agency \ncharged with implementing [congressional] directives in accordance with Presidential policy and \npriorities.\u201d  Dellinger I, 2025 WL 665041, at *26.  And Dellinger also seeks to distinguish Seila \nLaw and Collins as instances of \u201cprincipal officers leading single-headed agencies that exercise \nbinding regulatory and enforcement authority affecting private actors.\u201d  Opp\u2019n 7. \nBut Collins emphasized that \u201cthe nature and breadth of an agency\u2019s authority is not dispositive \nin determining whether Congress may limit the President\u2019s power to remove its head.\u201d  594 U.S. \nat 251\u201352.  It is for that very reason that three Justices only concurred in part in the holding, \nobserving that \u201c[a]ny \u2018agency led by a single Director,\u2019 no matter how much executive power it \nwields, now becomes subject to the requirement of at-will removal.\u201d  Id. at 273 (Kagan, J., \nconcurring in part and concurring in the judgment).  Whatever the merits of that expansion from \nSeila Law, it is binding on our court and applies no matter the \u201cnature\u201d or \u201cbreadth\u201d of its executive \nauthority. \n\n5 \n \nIn any event, the government has sufficiently demonstrated that Dellinger exercises at least \nenough authority to contradict the President\u2019s directives.  As Dellinger acknowledges, OSC \nrecently requested \u201ca stay of personnel actions with the MSPB concerning a recent termination of \nprobationary employees at the U.S. Department of Agriculture.\u201d  Opp\u2019n 13 n.1.  In fact, that request \ninvolves thousands of employees, Appellant Rule 28(j) Letter 1, and follows Dellinger\u2019s earlier \nsuccessful request for a stay involving six other employees, Mot. 9, 18.  Moreover, the Special \nCounsel\u2019s earlier request claimed that the MSPB \u201cmust\u201d grant a stay unless the request is \n\u201cinherently unreasonable.\u201d  Mot. 18.  To be able to obtain the reinstatement of thousands of \nemployees in a single agency, even if only temporarily, with such a vague standard of review seems \nto suggest the Special Counsel\u2019s powers are not as limited as he claims. \nIn a footnote in his opposition to the stay, Dellinger also argues that he is an inferior rather \nthan principal officer, Appellee Br. 13 n.2, but not even the court below was convinced by that \nargument, Dellinger I, 2025 WL 665041, at *19 n.18.  In evaluating whether an officer is principal \nor inferior, the Supreme Court has most recently \u201cfocused on whether the officer\u2019s work is \n\u2018directed and supervised\u2019 by a principal officer.\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 217 n.3.  As the district \ncourt observed, only \u201cthe President has the authority to remove the Special Counsel\u201d and \u201che is a \nPresidential appointee who must be confirmed by the Senate.\u201d  Dellinger I, 2025 WL 665041, at \n*19 n.18.  Thus, the government has shown that Dellinger is all but certain to be designated a \nprincipal officer. \nIn sum, the government has demonstrated a strong likelihood of success on the merits of its \nappeal and thus the first factor weighs in its favor. \n\n6 \n \nB. \nAs to weighing the relative harm, Dellinger argues that the government\u2019s asserted harms \u201cto \nthe Executive Branch, to the separation of powers, and to our democratic system\u201d are \u201cforeclosed,\u201d \nalthough he is unable to cite any binding precedent for that proposition.  Opp\u2019n 20.  Dellinger also \ndisputes  whether  any  injury  to  the  government  from  his  seeking  stays  of  the  removal  of \nprobationary employees is irreparable.  Id.  Even if that were so, there is no doubt that it is \nimpossible to unwind the days during which a President is \u201cdirect[ed] . . . to recognize and work \nwith an agency head whom he has already removed.\u201d  Dellinger II, 2025 WL 559669, at *16 \n(Katsas, J., dissenting)).  That requirement \u201cimpinges on the \u2018conclusive and preclusive\u2019 power \nthrough which the President controls the Executive Branch that he is responsible for supervising.\u201d  \nId. (quoting Trump, 603 U.S. at 608\u201309).  And the relative importance of the Special Counsel and \nduration of the district court\u2019s order, if it were to remain in place during the pendency of this appeal, \n\u201cgo[] to the extent\u2014not the character\u2014of the President\u2019s injury.\u201d  Id. \nConversely, Dellinger must \u201cmake a showing of irreparable injury sufficient in kind and \ndegree  to  override  the[]  factors  cutting  against  the  general  availability  of  []  injunctions  in \nGovernment personnel cases.\u201d  Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 84 (1974).  The government \nargues that Dellinger\u2019s injury is not irreparable because the traditional remedy for a removal claim \nis backpay.  Mot. 26 (citing Dellinger II, 2025 WL 559669, at *17 (Katsas, J., dissenting)); see \nalso Sampson, 415 U.S. at 90 (\u201c[T]emporary loss of income, ultimately to be recovered, does not \nusually constitute irreparable injury. . . . This premise is fortified by the Back Pay Act.\u201d).  Although \nDellinger \u201cnever even brought up the subject of his salary\u201d below,  Dellinger I, 2025 WL 665041, \nat *32, his complaint asks for an injunction to be paid \u201call wages and benefits owed to him,\u201d  \nCompl. 14 \u00b6 f.  So, he would likely be entitled to backpay if he were to prevail on appeal. \n\n7 \n \nInstead, Dellinger asserts he is injured by being \u201cdeprived of the statutory right to function in \noffice.\u201d  Opp\u2019n 20.  Assuming he is correct that his removal is statutorily ultra vires, and assuming \nthat his removal constitutes a cognizable injury, that does not mean such injury is irreparable and \nweighs in his favor.  Ultimately, a stay is \u201c\u2018an exercise of judicial discretion\u2019 and \u2018the propriety of \nits issue is dependent upon the circumstances of the particular case.\u2019\u201d  Nken, 556 U.S. at 433 (citing \nVirginia Railroad Co. v. United States, 272 U.S. 658, 672 (1926)).  Here, the circumstances cut in \nfavor of a stay.  At worst, Dellinger would remain out of office for a short period of time.  By \ncontrast, the potential injury to the government of both having its designated Acting Special \nCounsel sidelined and unable to act while also having to try and unravel Dellinger\u2019s actions is \nsubstantial.  Thus, the injury-focused factors also favor a stay. \nC. \nOrdinarily, the public interest factor merges with the harm to the government when the \ngovernment is a party.  Nken, 556 U.S. at 435.  Here, Dellinger asserts that it would \u201cseverely \nundermine the public interest\u201d to issue a stay because of the \u201ccritical importance\u201d of having a \nSpecial Counsel who enjoys removal protections and the \u201cpublic importance of a robust and \nproperly functioning OSC.\u201d  Opp\u2019n 21.  Never mind the tension between Dellinger\u2019s assertions \nthat OSC is critically important to the public interest but simultaneously lacks significant executive \npower.  The more obvious problem is that it is not clear how we could balance the Special \nCounsel\u2019s asserted public interest against the public interest asserted by the rest of the executive \nbranch.  And after all, \u201c[o]nly the President (along with the Vice President) is elected by the entire \nNation.\u201d Dellinger II, 2025 WL 559669, at *17 (Katsas, J., dissenting) (quoting Seila Law, 591 \nU.S. at 224).  At the least, this factor does not weigh in Dellinger\u2019s favor. \n* * * \n\n8 \n \nAccordingly, the first three Nken factors weigh in favor of a stay and the last factor, at \nminimum, does not weigh against it.  The government has therefore met its burden for the grant of \na stay. \nFor the foregoing reasons, we grant Appellants\u2019 motion for a stay pending appeal. \nSo ordered.\n\nClearinghouse file: https://clearinghouse-umich-production.s3.amazonaws.com/media/doc/156750.pdf\nExternal link: https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69697129/01208718493/hampton-dellinger-v-scott-bessent/\nClearinghouse summary: clearinghouse.net/doc/156750"

HAMPTON DELLINGER, SPECIAL COUNSEL  \nOF THE OFFICE OF SPECIAL COUNSEL  \nON APPLICATION TO VACATE THE ORDER ISSUED BY  \nTHE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE  \nDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA  \n[February 21, 2025]  \n  This matter concerns the President\u2019s action to remove \nHampton Dellinger from his position as Special Counsel for \nthe Office of Special Counsel.  Dellinger challenged his\nwithout-cause removal in the District Court for the District  \nof Columbia.  See 5 U. S. C. \u00a71211(b).  On February 12, \n2025, the District Court entered a temporary restraining \norder (TRO) providing that Dellinger should remain in of-\nfice until the court ruled on his motion for a preliminary \ninjunction.  The District Court has scheduled a hearing on \nthat motion for February 26, the day that the TRO expires.  \nSee Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 65(b)(2). \n  Pending before this Court is the Government\u2019s applica-\ntion to vacate the TRO.  Dellinger has filed a Response in  \nOpposition.  The Government then filed a reply.  The ques-\ntion is thus fully briefed before this Court. \n  Although it acknowledges that this Court typically does \nnot have appellate jurisdiction over TROs, the Government \nurges us to construe the TRO as a preliminary injunction or \nto exercise jurisdiction under the All Writs Act in light of \nthe core executive power assertedly restrained. Application \n31\u201332;  see  28  U. S. C.  \u00a71292(a)(1).

Mr. Dellinger re-\nsponded by suing the President and other officials on Feb-\nruary 10, claiming that \u00a71211(b) restricted the President\u2019s \nauthority to remove him.  ECF Doc. 1, at 1.   \n  Mr. Dellinger also sought interim equitable relief restor-\ning him to his post while his lawsuit unfolds.  Granting that  \nrequest, the district court issued a temporary restraining \norder (TRO) directing that Mr. Dellinger \u201cshall continue to \nserve as the Special Counsel\u201d until the court rules on his \napplication for a preliminary injunction.  ___ F. Supp. ___, \n___, 2025 WL 471022, *14 (D DC, Feb. 12, 2025).  Over \nJudge Katsas\u2019s dissent, a panel of  the D. C. Circuit held it \nlacked jurisdiction to review the TRO at that time.  App. to\nApplication to Vacate Order 33a (App.).  The President and \nother  defendants  promptly  filed  an  application  in  this \n \n\n  Cite as:  604 U. S. ____ (2025)  3 \n \nGORSUCH,  J., dissenting  \nCourt, asking us to vacate the district court\u2019s order.   \n  The Court instead holds the application in  abeyance.  \nPresumably, like the court of appeals, it harbors a concern \nthat the TRO may not yet have ripened into an appealable \norder.  Respectfully, I believe that it has and  that each ad-\nditional day where the order stands only serves to confirm \nthe point.  Unlike preliminary injunctions, of course, TROs\nare generally not appealable.  See id., at 1a (citing 28\nU. S. C. \u00a71292(a)(1)).  But exceptions exist, preventing dis-\ntrict courts from \u201cshield[ing]\u201d their \u201corders from appellate \nreview.\u201d  Sampson v. Murray, 415 U. S. 61, 87 (1974).  And \nas Judge Katsas recounted in detail below, here there are \npowerful reasons to look behind the label, acknowledge that \nthis TRO presently acts as a preliminary injunction, and \nreview its lawfulness.  App. 50a\u201353a; see Sampson, 415  \nU. S., at 87; 16 C. Wright, A. Miller, & E. Cooper, Federal \nPractice and Procedure \u00a73922.1 (3d ed. 2012).   \n  As a starting point in that review, consider what we know \nabout the remedy the district court ordered.  The court ef-\nfectively commanded the President and other Executive \nBranch officials to recognize and work with someone whom \nthe President sought to remove from office.  Whether la-\nbeled a TRO or a preliminary injunction, that order pro-\nvided an equitable remedy.  See, e.g., Advisory Committee\u2019s \n1937 Note on Fed. Rule Civ. Proc. 65, 28 U. S. C., p. 2648; \nFed. Equity Rule 73 (1912).  \n  Under this Court\u2019s precedents, however, a federal court \nmay issue an equitable remedy only if, at the time of the \nNation\u2019s founding, it was a remedy \u201ctraditionally accorded \nby courts of equity.\u201d  Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, S. A. v. \nAlliance Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U. S. 308, 319 (1999).  That \nlimitation would seem to pose a problem here, for courts of \nequity at the time of the founding were apparently power-\nless to \u201crestrain an executive officer from making a . . . re-\nmoval of a subordinate appointee.\u201d  White v. Berry, 171 \nU. S. 366, 377 (1898) (internal quotation marks omitted).  \n \n\n4  BESSENT v. DELLINGER \n   \nGORSUCH,  J., dissenting  \n\u201cNo English case\u201d involved \u201ca bill for an injunction to re-\nstrain the appointment or removal of a municipal officer.\u201d   \nIn re Sawyer, 124 U. S. 200, 212 (1888).   And state courts  \n\u201cdenied\u201d the \u201cpower of a court of equity to restrain . . . re-\nmoval\u201d in \u201cmany well considered\u201d decisions.  Ibid.  Given \nthat pattern of restraint, by the 1880s this Court considered\nit \u201cwell settled that a court of equity has no jurisdiction over \nthe appointment and removal of public officers.\u201d  Ibid.   \n  To be sure, throughout the Nation\u2019s history, various pres-\nidentially appointed officials like Mr. Dellinger have con-\ntested their removal\u2014and courts have heard and passed on\ntheir claims. But those officials have generally sought rem-\nedies like backpay, not injunctive relief like reinstatement.  \nE.g., Myers v. United States, 272 U. S. 52 (1926); Humph-\nrey\u2019s Executor v. United States, 295 U. S. 602 (1935).  The  \nclosest the parties have come to identifying a precedent for \nthe district court\u2019s remedial order in this case is \u201cjust a sin-\ngle, unpublished district-court decision purporting to enjoin \nthe President from removing [two] government official[s] \nfrom office.\u201d  App. 55a (Katsas, J., dissenting) (citing Berry  \nv. Reagan, No. 83\u20133182 (D DC, Nov. 14, 1983)).  And that \ncase  involved  members  of  \u201ca  temporary,  multi-member \nagency,\u201d App. 55a, not an official, like Mr. Dellinger, who \nwields significant prosecutorial and investigative power as \nthe sole head of a 129-person office, Application to Vacate \nOrder 6\u20138.   \n  In response to all this, Mr. Dellinger stresses that courts \nof law have traditionally entertained petitions for writs of \nquo warranto to decide \u201cwhich of two claimants [is] entitled \nto an office.\u201d  Brief in Opposition 32 (quoting Newman v. \nUnited States ex rel. Frizzell, 238 U. S. 537, 544 (1915)).  \nBut it is unclear how Mr. Dellinger might defend the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s exercise of its equitable remedial authority by  \npointing to a distinct legal remedy he never sought, the dis-\ntrict court never invoked, and the  procedures for which he \ndid not follow.  See D. C. Code \u00a716\u20133501 et seq. (2024);  \n \n\n  Cite as:  604 U. S. ____ (2025)  5 \n \nGORSUCH,  J., dissenting  \nJohnson v. Manhattan R. Co., 289 U. S. 479, 502 (1933); \nAndrade v. Lauer, 729 F. 2d 1475, 1498 (CADC 1984).  If  \nanything, the (potential) availability of quo warranto would  \nseem to cut against recognizing a novel equitable power to \nreturn an agency head to his office, for a \u201ccourt of equity \nwill not entertain a case for relief where the complainant \nhas an adequate legal remedy.\u201d  Case v.  Beauregard, 101 \nU. S. 688, 690 (1880).\n  The district court grappled with none of these complica-\ntions before ordering Mr. Dellinger\u2019s reinstatement. And if \nthere are answers to the questions its remedial order raises, \nthey appear nowhere in that court\u2019s decision.  Accordingly, \nI would vacate the district court\u2019s order and remand with  \ninstructions to consider the \u201cboundaries of traditional equi-\ntable relief.\u201d  Grupo Mexicano, 527 U. S., at 322.*  \n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014 \n*Given the questions associated with the district court\u2019s remedy, I do \nnot address at this time the President\u2019s contention, Application to Vacate \nOrder 11\u201312, and Judge Katsas\u2019s assessment, App. 54a\u201357a, that the \ndistrict court\u2019s order also relies on a  mistaken view of the merits of Mr. \nDellinger\u2019s removal claim.\n\nClearinghouse file: https://clearinghouse-umich-production.s3.amazonaws.com/media/doc/155963.pdf\nClearinghouse summary: clearinghouse.net/doc/155963"

Yet when it comes to independent agencies, none \nof that is true. Federal power is instead consolidated in a select few ac-\ncountable to no one. And that naturally leads to the expansion of that \npower.  \nAmici have an interest in ensuring that federal officials exercise \ntheir power\u2014power that flows from the States themselves\u2014within con-\nstitutional limits. After all, \u201c[s]eparation-of-powers principles\u201d do not just \n\u201cprotect each branch of government from incursion by the others\u201d; they \n\u201cprotect the individual\u201d and state sovereignty as well. Bond v. United \n1 \n\nStates, 564 U.S. 211, 222 (2011). The issue here\u2014and the separation-of-\npowers principles involved in resolving it\u2014go to the heart of the federal-\nist bargain struck by the Framers. \nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nRespondent Hampton Dellinger challenges President Trump\u2019s au-\nthority to remove him from his presidentially appointed position as Spe-\ncial Counsel. But as head of the Office of Special Counsel, respondent \nexercises significant investigative and prosecutorial authority within the \nexecutive branch and is answerable to no one except the President. Be-\ncause he is a principal officer exercising executive power on behalf of the \nPresident, the Constitution requires that he be removable at the will of \nthe President. \nThat  bedrock  principle  safeguards  state  sovereignty.  When  the \nStates surrendered some of their sovereign power to the federal govern-\nment upon joining the union, they never would have imagined unaccount-\nable officials wielding that power independent of anyone who must an-\nswer to the people or the States for its exercise. That was not what the \nConstitution promised them. Yet when it comes to independent agencies \nand tenure-protected executive officers, that is precisely what the States \n2 \n\nget. When independent agencies and tenure-protected officers wield ex-\necutive power outside the purview of a democratically elected President, \nit not only usurps the President\u2019s authority, it strikes at the core of the \ncompact the States agreed to at the Founding. And state sovereignty and \nindividual liberty suffer.  \nNor can courts grant the relief that respondent seeks. Just as Con-\ngress may not restrain the President\u2019s removal power over executive of-\nficials, courts may not order an executive official\u2019s reinstatement. That \nlimit on equity dates to the Founding and runs throughout this Court\u2019s \nprecedents. The rule ensures effective governance, respects state sover-\neignty, and yields reasoned jurisprudence. The Court should reaffirm \nwhat it held over a century ago: \u201c[A] court of equity has no jurisdiction \nover the appointment and removal of public officers,\u201d be they state or fed-\neral. In re Sawyer, 124 U.S. 200, 212 (1888). \nARGUMENT \nThe Court should grant the Secretary\u2019s application. Core separa-\ntion-of-powers principles, bolstered by long historical understanding, re-\nquire that the President have the authority to remove executive branch \nofficials. That limitation on Congress\u2019s power indirectly preserves state \n3 \n\nsovereignty by ensuring that \u201cindependent agencies\u201d are politically ac-\ncountable should they attempt to intrude in state affairs. And as the Sec-\nretary correctly argues, a federal court would in any event lack the au-\nthority to reinstate respondent to his post. \nI.  The President\u2019s power to remove executive officers is abso-\nlute, and at a minimum extends to the head of the Office of \nSpecial Counsel. \n\u201c\u2018[T]he \u2018executive Power\u2019\u2014all of it\u2014is \u2018vested in a President, who \nmust \u2018take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\u2019\u201d Seila Law LLC v. \nConsumer  Fin.  Prot.  Bureau,  591 U.S.  197,  203  (2020)  (quoting  U.S. \nConst. art. II, \u00a7 1, cl. 1; id. \u00a7 3). And \u201cif any power whatsoever is in its \nnature Executive, it is the power of appointing, overseeing, and control-\nling those who execute the laws.\u201d 1 Annals of Cong. 463 (1789) (J. Madi-\nson). That necessarily includes the authority to remove executive officers. \nIndeed, \u201clesser officers must remain accountable to the President,\u201d for it \nis his \u201cauthority they wield.\u201d Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 213. Without the \npower to remove, the President lacks the ability to compel compliance \nwith his directives, id. at 213\u201314, and thus to fulfill his oath to execute \nthe law, U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 3. \n4 \n\nGiven the \u201cnecessity of an energetic executive,\u201d The Federalist No. \n70, at 472 (Hamilton) (Jacob E. Cooke, ed., 1961), and the legislative \nbranch\u2019s historic tendency to \u201cdraw[] all power into its impetuous vortex,\u201d \nThe Federalist No. 48, at 333 (Madison) (Jacob E. Cooke, ed., 1961), it is \nvital that the President\u2019s authority to direct and supervise the executive \nbranch in the performance of its functions be protected from legislative \nencroachment. As a result, this Court has recognized only two exceptions \nto the President\u2019s otherwise \u201cexclusive and illimitable power of removal.\u201d \nHumphrey\u2019s Ex\u2019r v. United States, 295 U.S. 602, 627 (1935); see also Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 215 (referring to the President\u2019s \u201cunrestricted removal \npower\u201d). Neither exception covers the Special Counsel, and the Court can \nresolve this case on that basis alone. At any rate, both exceptions are \nbased on flawed rationales and are due to be overruled. \nThe first exception is for certain inferior officers, and it has been \napplied to only two officers: a naval cadet-engineer, United States v. Per-\nkins, 116 U.S. 483 (1886), and the independent counsel, Morrison v. Ol-\nson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988). In Morrison, for example, the Court held that \nCongress could insulate the independent counsel from at-will removal \nbecause that removal protection did not \u201cimpede the President\u2019s ability \n5 \n\nto perform his constitutional duty.\u201d 487 U.S. at 691. To the contrary, the \nCourt reasoned, the independent counsel was \u201can inferior officer under \nthe Appointments Clause, with limited jurisdiction and tenure and lack-\ning  policymaking  or  significant  administrative  authority.\u201d  Id.  Thus, \nwhile recognizing that the \u201cfunctions performed by the independent coun-\nsel are \u2018executive\u2019\u201d in a \u201csense,\u201d the Court did not believe that the power \nto control those functions was \u201cso central to the functioning of the Exec-\nutive Branch as to require as a matter of constitutional law that the coun-\nsel be terminable at will by the President.\u201d Id. at 691\u201392. \nThat narrow exception\u2014representing the \u201coutermost constitutional \nlimit[]\u201d on the President\u2019s removal power, Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 218\u2014\ndoes not apply here. Rather, the Special Counsel is a principal officer ap-\npointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate.1 The \nSpecial Counsel is therefore covered by this Court\u2019s decisions in Seila \nLaw, Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (2021), and Myers v. United States, \n \n1 Respondent cannot fairly assert that the Special Counsel is an in-\nferior officer, as the Special Counsel does not have a superior other than \nthe President\u2014the chief criterion this Court has recognized for determin-\ning whether an Officer of the United States is principal or inferior. See \nUnited States v. Arthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. 1, 13 (2021); Edmond v. United \nStates, 520 U.S. 651, 662\u201363 (1997). \n6 \n\n272 U.S. 52 (1926). In Seila Law and Collins, this Court held that a single \nprincipal officer serving as the head of an executive agency could not be \ntenure-protected. In Myers, this Court held that even an inferior officer \nappointed by the President with the advice and consent of the Senate (a \npostmaster first class supervised by the Postmaster General) was subject \nto the plenary removal authority of the President.  \nEven if the Special Counsel were analogous in some respects to the \nindependent counsel (due to their both possessing some prosecutorial \nfunctions), the continuing legitimacy of Morrison is questionable. As Jus-\ntice Scalia pointed out his dissent in Morrison, \u201c[t]he case is over\u201d when \none acknowledges that a statute \u201creduces the amount of control or super-\nvision\u201d that the President has over \u201cthe prosecutorial function.\u201d 487 U.S. \nat 708 (Scalia, J., dissenting) (quoting 487 U.S. at 695). \u201cIt is not for us \nto determine, and we have never presumed to determine, how much of \nthe purely executive powers of government must be within the full con-\ntrol of the President.\u201d Id. at 709. Rather, \u201c[t]he Constitution prescribes \nthat they all are.\u201d Id. \nThat accords with constitutional history. The President\u2019s removal \npower was \u201cdiscussed extensively in Congress when the first executive \n7 \n\ndepartments were created,\u201d Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 214, and the \u201cview \nthat \u2018prevailed\u2019\u201d in the \u201cFirst Congress[]\u201d was that the President had the \n\u201cpower to oversee executive officers through removal,\u201d id. (quoting a case \nquoting Letter from James Madison to Thomas Jefferson (June 30, 1789), \nin 16 Documentary History of the First Federal Congress 893 (2004)). Not \nsome executive officials, but all of them. If this Court ever has occasion \nto revisit Morrison, it should heed Justice Scalia\u2019s dissent and overrule \nthat decision. \nThe second exception, recognized in Humphrey\u2019s Executor and later \nin Wiener v. United States, 357 U.S. 349, 356 (1958), is for \u201ca multimem-\nber body of experts, balanced along partisan lines, that perform[s] legis-\nlative and judicial functions and [i]s said not to exercise any executive \npower.\u201d Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 216. Those cases reasoned that \u201cquasi-\njudicial\u201d and \u201cquasi-legislative\u201d bodies do not implicate the President\u2019s \n\u201cunrestrictable power . . . to remove purely executive officers.\u201d Id. at 217. \nThat exception likewise has no application here. The Office of Special \nCounsel is \u201cheaded by the Special Counsel,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(a), who is \nobviously a single officer, not a multi-member body. And even if it were \nsomehow  applicable,  Humphrey\u2019s  Executor  is  even  more  ripe  for \n8 \n\noverruling than Morrison. \u201cThe decision in Humphrey\u2019s Executor poses a \ndirect threat to our constitutional structure and, as a result, the liberty \nof the American people.\u201d Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 239 (Thomas, J., concur-\nring, joined by Gorsuch, J.); see also PHH Corp. v. CFPB, 881 F.3d 75, \n165 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (\u201cBecause of their mas-\nsive power and the absence of Presidential supervision and direction, in-\ndependent agencies pose a significant threat to individual liberty and to \nthe constitutional system of separation of powers and checks and bal-\nances.\u201d). The time is right for this Court to \u201crepudiate what is left of this \nerroneous precedent.\u201d Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 239 (Thomas, J., concur-\nring). \nHumphrey\u2019s Executor is the foundation for the modern ill known as \nthe  \u201cindependent  agency.\u201d  In  Humphrey\u2019s  Executor,  the  Court  enter-\ntained the fiction that such agencies \u201cexercise[] no part of the executive \npower vested by the Constitution in the President.\u201d 295 U.S. at 628. We \nnow know, however, that independent agencies have exercised \u201cconsider-\nable executive power without Presidential oversight.\u201d Seila Law, 591 \nU.S. at 240 (Thomas, J., concurring). The Special Counsel is a notable \nexample.  He  enforces  a  host  of  statutes,  including  the  Civil  Service \n9 \n\nReform Act and various anti-discrimination laws, see 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1216, by \ninitiating disciplinary actions against federal employees and prosecuting \ncomplaints of prohibited personnel practices before the Merit Systems \nProtection Board, see, e.g., id. \u00a7\u00a7 1215\u20131216. To aid in this enforcement, \nhe is empowered to \u201cinvestigate\u201d complaints, id. \u00a7 1212, by \u201cissu[ing] sub-\npoenas\u201d and \u201corder[ing] the taking of depositions,\u201d id. \u00a7 1212(b)(2). He \nmay also appoint \u201cthe legal, administrative, and support personnel nec-\nessary to perform the functions of the Special Counsel,\u201d id. \u00a7 1212(d)(1), \nand he \u201cmay prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to perform \nthe functions of the Special Counsel,\u201d id. \u00a7 1212(e). All of these functions \nare quintessentially executive, subject to the President\u2019s authority to \n\u201ctake Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\u201d U.S. Const. art. II, \u00a7 3. \nYet Congress has purported to circumscribe the President\u2019s power to re-\nmove the Special Counsel: \u201cThe Special Counsel may be removed by the \nPresident only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d \n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b). \nHumphrey\u2019s Executor was also wrong to recognize a class of offic-\ners\u2014\u201ca de facto fourth branch of Government,\u201d Seila Law, 591 U.S. at \n240 (Thomas, J., concurring)\u2014that acts \u201cin part quasi-legislatively and \n10 \n\nin part quasi-judicially.\u201d 295 U.S. at 628. Humphrey\u2019s Executor did so \nbased on reasoning \u201cdevoid of textual or historical precedent for the novel \nprinciple it set forth.\u201d Morrison, 487 U.S. at 726 (Scalia, J., dissenting). \nIf an officer exercises \u201cquasi-legislative\u201d power, that officer belongs in the \nlegislative branch. If, on the other hand, an officer exercises \u201cquasi-adju-\ndicative\u201d power, that officer belongs in the judicial branch. It could hardly \nbe otherwise, since Congress \u201clacks the authority to delegate its legisla-\ntive power.\u201d Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 247 (Thomas, J., concurring) (citing \nWhitman v. Am. Trucking Ass\u2019ns, Inc., 531 U.S. 457, 472 (2001)). Con-\ngress also \u201ccannot authorize the use of judicial power by officers acting \noutside of the bounds of Article III.\u201d Id. (citing Stern v. Marshall, 564 U.S. \n462, 484 (2011)).2 \n \n2 There are exceptions, of course, as part of the checks and balances \nof government. For example, the Constitution gives the President a lim-\nited role in the legislative process (e.g., to \u201crecommend to [Congress] such \nMeasures as he shall judge necessary and expedient,\u201d U.S. Const. art. II, \n\u00a7 3; and to decide whether to \u201capprove\u201d an act of Congress upon present-\nment, U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 7, cl. 2). An executive officer might assist the \nPresident in performing these duties. But these explicit textual excep-\ntions merely prove the rule that no implicit exceptions for \u201cquasi-legisla-\ntive\u201d or \u201cquasi-adjudicative\u201d functions exist. \n11 \n\nNot surprisingly, Humphrey\u2019s Executor has seen its already shaky \nfoundations eroded over the years. In Morrison, this Court sidestepped \nHumphrey\u2019s  Executor\u2019s  reliance  \u201con  the  terms  \u2018quasi-legislative\u2019  and \n\u2018quasi-judicial,\u2019\u201d instead grounding its endorsement of tenure protection \nfor the independent counsel on the conclusion that tenure protection did \nnot \u201cunduly trammel[] on executive authority.\u201d 487 U.S. at 689, 691. The \ndecision similarly avoided scrutiny in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public \nCompany Accounting Oversight Board, in part because the parties there \n\u201cagree[d] that the Commissioners [of the Securities and Exchange Com-\nmission] cannot themselves be removed by the President except under \nthe Humphrey\u2019s Executor standard of \u2018inefficiency, neglect of duty, or \nmalfeasance in office.\u2019\u201d 561 U.S. 477, 487 (2010) (quoting Humphrey\u2019s \nEx\u2019r, 295 U.S. at 620). But the majority opinion in Free Enterprise Fund \nis replete with reminders that allowing officers to \u201cexecute the laws\u201d \nwithout plenary presidential supervision \u201cis contrary to Article II\u2019s vest-\ning of the executive power in the President\u201d\u2014a principle squarely in con-\nflict with Humphrey\u2019s Executor. 561 U.S. at 496. And most recently, in \nSeila Law and again in Collins, this Court took particular care not to \nwiden the application of Humphrey\u2019s Executor beyond its essential facts. \n12 \n\nFor all these reasons, respondent is not entitled to the removal pro-\ntections set forth in 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b), and that statute should be held \nunconstitutional. And though the Court need not do so to grant the Sec-\nretary\u2019s application to vacate the district court\u2019s order of reinstatement, \nthe Court should hold, in an appropriate case, that Morrison and Humph-\nrey\u2019s Executor are no longer good law. Those cases should not serve as \nprecedent for further encroachment on the President\u2019s power of removal \nby the legislative branch. \nII.  By threatening the separation of powers, \u201cindependent\u201d ex-\necutive officers and agencies in turn threaten state sover-\neignty. \nWhether Congress may shield executive officials from presidential \noversight has grave ramifications for amici States. Before joining the un-\nion, \u201cthe several States had absolute and unlimited sovereignty within \ntheir respective boundaries.\u201d Respublica v. Cobbett, 3 U.S. 467, 473 (Pa. \n1798). By entering a compact under the Constitution, the States \u201csurren-\ndered\u201d some of that sovereignty to the United States. Chisholm v. Geor-\ngia, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 419, 435 (1793) (Iredell, J., dissenting). But \u201cin every \ninstance where [their] sovereignty ha[d] not been delegated to the United \nStates, [the States remained] completely sovereign.\u201d Id. The result was a \n13 \n\n\u201csystem of government\u201d that \u201cdiffer[ed], in form and spirit, from all other \ngovernments, that ha[d] [t]heretofore existed in the world\u201d\u2014a carefully \ncalibrated balance of power between States and the federal government. \nRespublica, 3 U.S. at 473. \u201c[T]he United States ha[s] no claim to any au-\nthority but such as the States have surrendered to [it].\u201d Chisholm, 2 U.S. \nat 435 (Iredell, J., dissenting).  \nWhen ceding that sovereign power, the States ensured that it would \nbe  divided  among  distinct  branches  of  the  federal  government.  They \n\u201cviewed the principle of the separation of powers as the central guarantee \nof a just government.\u201d Freytag v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, 501 U.S. \n868, 870 (1991). To protect their sovereignty and preserve individual lib-\nerty, the founding States \u201cscrupulously avoid[ed] concentrating power in \nthe hands of any single individual.\u201d Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 223. The one \nexception was the executive branch. Because an \u201cenergetic executive\u201d is \n\u201cessential\u201d to perform that branch\u2019s \u201cunique responsibilities,\u201d the Fram-\ners decided to \u201cfortif[y]\u201d that power in \u201cone man.\u201d Id. at 223\u201324. To miti-\ngate their concerns over power consolidation, they made the executive \nbranch \u201cthe most democratic and politically accountable\u201d in the federal \ngovernment.  Id.  at  224.  Only  the  President  and  Vice  President  are \n14 \n\n\u201celected by the entire Nation.\u201d Id. And because of the nature of the elec-\ntoral college, they are not just elected by the People, but also by the \nStates. This carefully calibrated \u201callocation of powers\u201d\u2014essential to the \ncompact the States agreed to upon joining the union\u2014protects \u201clibert[y]\u201d \nand state \u201csovereignty.\u201d Bond, 564 U.S. at 221. \nIndependent agencies threaten that compact. See, e,g., Seila Law, \n591  U.S.  at  246  (Thomas,  J.,  concurring)  (observing  that  cases  like \nHumphrey\u2019s Executor \u201claid the foundation for a fundamental departure \nfrom our constitutional structure\u201d). They combine the founding States\u2019 \nworst fears: the consolidation of power in one or a few democratically un-\naccountable people. See 591 U.S. at 222\u201324. Without \u201ca politically ac-\ncountable officer [to] take responsibility\u201d for the exercise of executive \npower, \u201cthe public [and the States] can only wonder \u2018on whom the blame \nor  the  punishment  of  a  pernicious  measure,  or  series  of  pernicious \nmeasures ought really to fall.\u201d Arthrex, 594 U.S at 16 (quoting The Fed-\neralist No. 70, at 476 (A. Hamilton) (Jacob E. Cooke, ed., 1961)). By evis-\ncerating the \u201cclear and effective chain of command down from the Presi-\ndent, on whom all people vote,\u201d the actions of independent agencies are \n15 \n\ndeprived of \u201clegitimacy and accountability to the public\u201d and the States. \nId. at 11 (internal quotation marks omitted). \nOne need not search long for an egregious example. Just last year, \nthe Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) banned noncompete clauses in \nemployment contracts nationwide. Non-Compete Clause Rule, 89 Fed. \nReg. 38,342 (May 7, 2024). In \u201cthe most extraordinary assertion of au-\nthority in the Commission\u2019s history,\u201d a few unaccountable commissioners \n\u201cprohibit[ed] a business practice that has been lawful for centuries\u201d and \n\u201cinvalidate[d] thirty million existing contracts.\u201d Fed. Trade Comm\u2019n, Dis-\nsenting  Statement  of  Commissioner  Andrew  N.  Ferguson  1  (June  28, \n2024), https://tinyurl.com/3j8dxrtx. And they did so even though \u201c[c]om-\nmercial agreements traditionally are the domain of state law.\u201d Aronson \nv. Quick Point Pencil Co., 440 U.S. 257, 262 (1979). Nor did the FTC care \nthat 46 states had exercised their sovereign authority to permit noncom-\npete agreements in some form. See Ferguson Dissent at 14. But because \nof the FTC\u2019s independence, the States have no one to hold to account for \nthat  dramatic  intrusion  on  their  sovereignty.3  The  FTC  wields \n \n3 The FTC\u2019s authority to promulgate the non-compete rule is being \ntested in several pending cases. See Ryan, LLC v. FTC, No. 3:24-cv-986, \n \n16 \n\nextraordinary authority to usurp state sovereignty with no political ac-\ncountability. That is not the sovereign power the States ceded the federal \ngovernment when they joined the union.   \nIII.  Federal courts lack equitable authority to reinstate public \nofficials. \nNot only is respondent wrong on the merits, he is wrong on the rem-\nedy. Federal courts may not reinstate public officers absent an act of Con-\ngress. See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(g) (authorizing courts to \u201creinstate[]\u201d \nemployees who suffer discrimination). Respondent has cited no such act. \nNor is Congress\u2019s silence surprising\u2014orders reinstating public officials \nhamper effective governance, invade state sovereignty, and beget rushed \njurisprudence. \nA. Respondent seeks relief the courts cannot grant. He requests the \nequitable remedy of reinstatement to his role as head of the Office of Spe-\ncial Counsel. See DE1 at 13\u201314, Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 1:25-cv-385 \n(D.D.C.). Yet the only equitable remedies that a federal court may grant \nare those that were \u201ctraditionally accorded by courts of equity.\u201d Grupo \n \n2024 WL 3879954 (N.D. Tex. Aug. 20, 2024), appeal docketed, No. 24-\n10951 (5th Cir. Oct. 18, 2024); Props. of the Vills., Inc. v. FTC, No. 5:24-\ncv-316, 2024 WL 3870380 (M.D. Fla. Aug. 15, 2024), appeal docketed, No. \n24-13102 (11th Cir. Sept. 24, 2024). \n17 \n\nMexicano de Desarrollo S.A. v. All. Bond Fund, Inc., 527 U.S. 308, 318 \n(1999). And history teaches that \u201c[a] court of equity has no jurisdiction \nover the appointment and removal of public officers.\u201d Walton v. House of \nRepresentatives of Okla., 265 U.S. 487, 490 (1924); see Sawyer, 124 U.S. \nat 210 (\u201cIt is equally well settled that a court of equity has no jurisdiction \nover the appointment and removal of public officers[.]\u201d). \nThat rule flows from English common law. Recognizing the critical \n\u201cdistinction between judicial and political power,\u201d English courts histori-\ncally would not wield equity to vindicate a litigant\u2019s \u201cpolitical right[]\u201d to \noffice. Georgia v. Stanton, 73 U.S. (6 Wall.) 50, 71, 76 & n.20 (1867) (col-\nlecting cases); see Sawyer, 124 U.S. at 212 (collecting cases, including \nAtt\u2019y Gen. v. Earl of Clarendon, 17 Ves. Jr. 491, 498, 34 Eng. Rep. 190, \n193 (Ch. 1810)). In Earl of Clarendon, for instance, the English Court of \nChancery declined to remove public-school officers on the ground that \nthey lacked necessary legal qualifications. 17 Ves. Jr. at 493, 34 Eng. Rep. \nat 191. According to that court, a court of equity \u201chas no jurisdiction with \nregard either to the election or the [removal] of\u201d officers. Id. at 498, 34 \nEng. Rep. at 193. Contemporary English cases tracked that reasoning. \nSee  also  Joseph  Story,  Commentaries  on  Equity  Pleadings  and  the \n18 \n\nIncidents Thereof \u00a7\u00a7 467\u201370 (2d ed. 1840) (explaining that traditional eq-\nuity courts would not adjudicate rights of a \u201cpolitical nature\u201d and citing \nexamples); Seth Davis, Empire in Equity, 97 Notre Dame L. Rev. 1985, \n2011\u201312 (2022).4 \nAmerican courts imported that principle after the Framing. In the \nearly  19th  century,  courts  nationwide  denied  that  equity  chancellors \ncould afford a removed official relief, even when the official\u2019s ouster was \nillegal and unauthorized. Tappan v. Gray, 9 Paige Ch. 506, 508\u201309 (Ch. \nCt. N.Y. 1842); see also Hagner, 7 Watts & Serg. at 105; Sawyer, 124 U.S. \n \n4 Although Earl of Clarendon and some other cases cited in Sawyer \ninvolved corporate officers, those legal entities were historically treated \nmore like governments and public entities. Colonial governments, for \ninstance, were created through corporate charters, with \u201cshareholders\u201d \nacting like modern-day voters and voting for corporate boards that looked \nlike modern-day state and local governments. Nikolas Bowie, Why the \nConstitution Was Written Down, 71 Stan. L. Rev. 1397, 1416\u201321 (2018); \nsee also Letter from John Adams to the Inhabitants of the Colony of \nMassachusetts-Bay, April 1775, https://founders.archives.gov/documents/\nAdams/06-02-02-0072-0015.  And  as  the  Pennsylvania  Supreme  Court \nnoted  in  Hagner  v.  Heyberger,  limits  on  equitable  jurisdiction  that \napplied to \u201cprivate corporations\u201d apply \u201c\u00e0 fortiori\u201d to \u201cthe case of a public \nofficer of a municipal character.\u201d 7 Watts & Serg. 104, 105 (Penn. 1844); \nsee also W.S. Holdsworth, English Corporation Law in the 16th and 17th \nCenturies, 31 Yale L.J. 382, 383\u201384 (1922) (noting that for both public \nand private corporations, \u201ccreation by and subordination to the state are \nthe only terms upon which the existence of large associations of men can \nbe safely allowed to lead an active life\u201d).  \n19 \n\nat 212 (collecting cases). Hagner is emblematic. In that case, the Supreme \nCourt of Pennsylvania declined to enjoin a defendant from unlawfully \nacting as a school director because it possessed no more power than \u201can \nEnglish court of chancery.\u201d Hagner, 7 Watts & Serg. at 106\u201307. Because \nchancery courts traditionally \u201cwould not sustain the injunction proceed-\ning to try the election or [removal] of corporators of any description,\u201d \nPennsylvania\u2019s high court held that it could not either. Id. Other courts \ntook a similar tact throughout Reconstruction.5 \nThis Court later confirmed that historical equitable constraint in \nSawyer. There, a locally elected officer sought an injunction from a fed-\neral court barring local officials from removing him. 124 U.S. at 201. Af-\nter the local officials were held in contempt of that injunction, the Court \nissued a writ of habeas corpus to vacate their convictions because the \n \n5 See, e.g., Cochran v. McCleary, 22 Iowa 75, 91 (1867) (\u201cThe right \nto a public office or franchise cannot, as the authorities above cited show, \nbe determined in equity.\u201d); Sheridan v. Colvin, 78 Ill. 237, 247 (1875) (\u201cA \ncourt of equity is not a proper tribunal for determining disputed ques-\ntions concerning the appointment of public officers, or their right to hold \noffice[.]\u201d); Delahanty v. Warner, 75 Ill. 185, 186 (1874) (court of chancery \nhad no power to restrain local officials from removing the superintendent \nof streets from his post); Beebe v. Robinson, 52 Ala. 66, 73 (1875) (similar); \nTaylor v. Kercheval, 82 F. 497, 499 (C.C.D. Ind. 1897) (similar); State ex \nrel. McCaffery v. Aloe, 54 S.W. 494, 496 (Mo. 1899) (similar). \n20 \n\ninjunction was issued without jurisdiction. The Court explained that a \nfederal court in equity \u201chas no jurisdiction . . . over the appointment and \nremoval of public officials.\u201d Id. at 210. And a wall of contemporary trea-\ntises echoed that understanding.6 As one 19th-century commentator put \nit, \u201c[n]o principle of the law of injunctions, and perhaps no doctrine of \nequity jurisprudence, is more definitely fixed or more clearly established \nthan that courts of equity will not interfere by injunction to determine \nquestions concerning the appointment of public officers or their title to \noffice.\u201d 2 High, Law of Injunctions \u00a7 1312. \nThis Court has doubled down on that rule. A decade after Sawyer, \nthe Court reiterated that equity courts may \u201cnot, by injunction, restrain \nan executive officer from making a wrongful removal of a subordinate \nappointee, nor restrain the appointment of another.\u201d White v. Berry, 171 \nU.S. 366, 377 (1898). The Court restated the point in Walton: While fed-\neral  courts  are  \u201cparticularly  . . .  without  jurisdiction  over  the \n \n6 See 2 James L. High, Treatise on the Law of Injunctions \u00a7 1312 (2d \ned. 1880); 1 Howard Clifford Joyce, A Treatise on the Law Relating to In-\njunctions \u00a7 55 (1909); 4 John Norton Pomeroy, A Treatise on Equity Ju-\nrisprudence \u00a7 1760 (4th ed. 1918); 2 Eugene McQuillin, A Treatise on the \nLaw of Municipal Corporations \u00a7 582 (1911). \n21 \n\nappointment and removal of state officers,\u201d they no more possess \u201cjuris-\ndiction over the appointment and removal of [other] public officers.\u201d 265 \nU.S. at 490 (emphasis added). And it repeated the principle in Baker v. \nCarr\u2014\u201cfederal equity power [may] not be exercised to enjoin a state pro-\nceeding to remove a public officer.\u201d 369 U.S. 186, 231 (1962); see also Fin-\neran v. Bailey, 2 F.2d 363, 363 (5th Cir. 1924) (\u201cIt is well settled by the \ndecisions of the Supreme Court that a District Court of the United States \nhas no jurisdiction over the appointment and removal of public officers.\u201d).  \nIn contrast, there is no established historical tradition of equity \ncourts reinstalling officials, at least not without express statutory author-\nization. \u201cNo English case has been found of a bill for an injunction to re-\nstrain the appointment or removal of a municipal officer.\u201d Sawyer, 124 \nU.S. at 212. Aside from the outlier case identified in the Government\u2019s \napplication, see Berry v. Reagan, No. 83-3182, 1983 WL 538, at *2 (D.D.C. \nNov. 14, 1983), we know of no case in which a federal court has ordered \nthe reinstatement respondent seeks.7 The lack of historical pedigree for \n \n7 The only other arguable candidate we have found is Bond v. Floyd, \nin which this Court held that the Georgia legislature violated the First \nAmendment in refusing to seat a newly elected member for engaging in \nanti-Vietnam War speech while the member-elect was a private citizen. \n \n22 \n\nreinstatement suggests that it \u201cwas unknown to traditional equity prac-\ntice,\u201d Grupo Mexicano, 527 U.S. at 327, and divorced from the \u201cjurisdic-\ntion in equity exercised by the High Court of Chancery in England at the \ntime of the adoption of the Constitution and the enactment of the original \nJudiciary Act, 1789 (1 Stat. 73),\u201d id. at 318\u201319. \nB. Tradition is often grounded in common sense. Here, there are at \nleast three reasons why courts should not wade into the messy business \nof reinstatement. \nFirst, reinstatement hampers effective governance. Like a grain of \nsand in a gear, forcing the sovereign to retain an official it believes is \nunfit threatens to halt the levers of government and risks intra-office \n\u201cchaos.\u201d Nixon v. United States, 506 U.S. 224, 236 (1993) (questioning \nwhat relief a federal court could grant a judge who had been impeached \nand removed from office); Abbott v. Thetford, 529 F.2d 695, 708 (5th Cir. \n \n385 U.S. 116, 137 (1966). But Bond v. Floyd did not grapple with the \nlimits on the federal courts\u2019 remedial authority discussed by Walton or \nSawyer. See id. At most, Bond v. Floyd represents an implicit \u201cdrive-by\u201d \nruling that carries \u201cno precedential effect.\u201d Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Bet-\nter Env\u2019t, 523 U.S. 83, 91 (1998). The issue of the equitable authority of \nthe federal courts \u201cmerely lurk[ed] in the record,\u201d so the holding of Bond \nv. Floyd cannot \u201cbe considered as having . . . constitute[d] precedent[]\u201d on \nthe question. Webster v. Fall, 266 U.S. 507, 511 (1925). \n23 \n\n1976) (Gewin, J., dissenting) (arguing that reinstating a state judicial \nemployee would impair the court\u2019s judicial functions), majority vacated \nand dissent adopted upon reh\u2019g en banc, 534 F.2d 1101 (5th Cir. 1976). \nSecond, reinstatement invades state sovereignty. \u201cThe authority of \nthe people of the States to determine\u201d their state officers \u201cgoes beyond an \narea traditionally regulated by the States; it is a decision of the most fun-\ndamental sort for a sovereign entity\u201d that lies at \u201cthe heart of representa-\ntive government.\u201d Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460, 463 (1991). The \nhistorical limit on federal reinstatement power preserves \u201cthe scrupulous \nregard for the rightful independence of state governments which should \nat all times actuate the federal courts.\u201d Ala. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n v. S. Ry. \nCo., 341 U.S. 341, 349 (1951). \nFinally, reinstatement encourages rushed jurisprudence. When of-\nficials believe that reinstatement lies just behind the courthouse door, \nthey will often seek emergency injunctive relief. See, e.g., Warren v. De-\nSantis, No. 4:22-cv-302 (N.D. Fla.) (in which a district judge ordered an \nextraordinarily compressed trial schedule of just over three months in a \ncase posing many complex issues of constitutional significance). Those \nfast-paced proceedings \u201ctend to force judges into making rushed, high-\n24 \n\nstakes, low-information decisions\u201d on constitutional issues of immense \nimportance. Dep\u2019t of Homeland Sec. v. New York, 140 S. Ct. 599, 600 \n(2020) (mem.) (Gorsuch, J., concurring). Were this Court to clarify that \nreinstatement is unavailable, there would be no need to rush a ruling, \nleaving courts with enough time to thoroughly consider the legal ques-\ntions presented. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant the Secretary\u2019s application to vacate the \norder of the district court. \nDated: February 19, 2025  Respectfully submitted, \n \n  JAMES UTHMEIER \n  Attorney General of Florida \n \nJEFFREY PAUL DESOUSA  \nActing Solicitor General \nCounsel of Record \nNATHAN A.

At 7:22 p.m., Sergio N. Gor, identified as an Assistant to the President, Director of \nPresidential  Personnel  Office,  informed  plaintiff  that  his  position  was  terminated  without \nidentifying any reason.  Ex. A to Compl. [Dkt. # 1-1] at 1.   \nOn Monday, February 10, 2025, plaintiff sued to challenge the purported termination, and \nhe moved for a temporary restraining order.  See Compl. [Dkt. # 1]; Pl.\u2019s Mot. for a Temporary \nRestraining Order [Dkt. # 2] (\u201cPl.\u2019s TRO\u201d).  On that date, the Court entered a short administrative \nstay preserving the status quo while the parties briefed the matter, citing authority defining \u201cstatus \nquo\u201d as \u201c\u2018the regime in place\u2019 before the challenged action . . . or \u2018the last uncontested status which \npreceded the pending controversy.\u2019\u201d  See Minute Order (Feb. 10, 2025), quoting Huisha-Huisha \nv. Mayorkas, 27 F.4th 718, 733\u201334 (D.C. Cir. 2022) and District 50, United Mine Workers of Am. \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 27     Filed 02/26/25     Page 2 of 5\nv. Int\u2019l Union, United Mine Workers of Am., 412 F.2d 165, 168 (D.C. Cir. 1969).  Defendants filed \ntheir opposition to the temporary restraining order the next day, February 11. See Defs.\u2019 Opp. to \nPl.\u2019s TRO [Dkt. # 11].   \nOn February 12, 2025, the Court issued a temporary restraining order.  See Order [Dkt. \n# 14].  It was entered with notice to the opposing party, and it stated that it would remain in force \nuntil the Court ruled on plaintiff\u2019s request for preliminary injunction.  See id. at 26 (\u201c[F]rom the \ndate of entry of this order until the Court rules on the entry of preliminary injunction, plaintiff \nHampton Dellinger shall continue to serve as Special Counsel . . . .\u201d).  The Court scheduled the \npreliminary injunction hearing for a date 14 days later:  February 26.  Id. at 27.   Given the terms \nof Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65 and the understandings expressed by the Supreme Court and \nthe Court of Appeals, the temporary restraining order expires today. \nWhen the TRO was issued on February 12, plaintiff had not yet had the opportunity to \nreply to the defendants\u2019 opposition, so the Court established a briefing schedule.  It also directed \nthe parties to inform the Court of their positions as to whether the Court should advance the \nconsideration of the merits and consolidate it with the preliminary injunction hearing under Rule \nof Civil Procedure 65(a)(2) by February 14, 2025.  Id. at 26\u201327.   \n  In the meantime, on February 12, defendants noticed an appeal of the temporary restraining \norder.  See Defs.\u2019 Notice of Appeal [Dkt. # 15].   \nOn February 14, the Court received a joint status report from the parties with their positions \non consolidation:  plaintiff deferred to the Court, and defendants stated their preference for \nutilizing the procedure that would result in the prompt issuance of a decision on the merits.  See \nJoint Status Report [Dkt. # 20] at 1\u20132.  Based on that submission, the Court entered an order \n \nconsolidating  the  preliminary  injunction  with  the  merits,  and  it  called  for  the  expeditious \n2 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 27     Filed 02/26/25     Page 3 of 5\nsubmission of cross motions for summary judgment, culminating with the hearing today and the \nfinal reply being filed tomorrow.  See Minute Order (Feb. 15, 2025).  It also informed the parties \nthat they had the option of incorporating or relying upon previously filed memoranda in support \nof those motions.  Id.   \nOn February 15, 2025, the Court of Appeals dismissed defendants\u2019 appeal for lack of \njurisdiction since the temporary restraining order was not a final order.  See Order, Dellinger v. \nBessent, 25-5028 (Feb. 15, 2025).  On February 16, defendants filed an application with the \nSupreme Court seeking immediate review of the temporary restraining order.  See Appl. to Vacate \nthe Order, Bessent v. Dellinger, No. 24A (Feb. 16, 2025).  On February 20, plaintiff filed his reply \nto the opposition to the motion for interim relief, raising some arguments that had not been \nadvanced in the initial motion.            \n  On Friday, February 21, 2025, five days after the application was filed, the Supreme Court \nannounced that it would hold the application in abeyance for the remainder of the fourteen days \nuntil the temporary restraining order was due to expire, that is, until Feb 26, the date of the hearing.  \nBessent v. Dellinger, 604 U.S. __ (2025).   \n  Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(b)(2), a temporary restraining order without \nnotice is valid for a period \u201cnot to exceed 14 days . . . unless before that time the court, for good \ncause, extends it for a like period or the adverse party consents to a longer extension.\u201d  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 65(b)(2).  While Rule 65(b)(2) is silent on the timeline for temporary restraining orders \nentered with notice, it is generally accepted that the standard  fourteen days followed by a \nfourteen-day extension for good cause applies to a TRO entered with notice as well.  See 11A \n \nCharles A. Wright, Federal Practice & Procedure \u00a7 2953 (3d ed. 2024) (\u201cThe text of Rule 65(b) \nseems to exclude any possibility that a temporary restraining order can remain in force beyond 28 \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 27     Filed 02/26/25     Page 4 of 5\ndays. . . .  It also has been held that this time limitation applies even when the order is not issued \nex parte and both notice and a hearing are held.\u201d).  If a TRO lasts longer than twenty-eight days, \ncourts will construe it to be a preliminary injunction, which would be appealable immediately.  Id.; \nsee Nat\u2019l Mediation Bd. v. Airline Pilots Ass\u2019n, Int\u2019l, 323 F.2d 305, 305 (D.C. Cir. 1963).  \nThe Court is well aware that the case is in the very unusual posture of being the subject of \nan application before the Supreme Court before a final order has been issued and before the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the District Columbia has had the opportunity to review that final \norder.  It recognizes that the Supreme Court \u2013 with the understanding that the TRO expires at \nmidnight tonight \u2013 is holding the application in abeyance until that time.  So it is incumbent upon \nthis Court to resolve this matter even more expeditiously than the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure \nwould ordinarily permit; and the Court will do so.   \nGiven  the  significance  of  the  constitutional  questions  presented,  though,  it  is  also \nincumbent upon the Court to give full consideration to all of the arguments advanced during \ntoday\u2019s hearing before it finalizes its opinion.  It is also necessary to give close consideration to \nall of the pleadings submitted by the parties after the TRO issued, and to rule on questions raised \nafter the defendants asked the Supreme Court to take the case. This includes defendants\u2019 thirty-\npage motion for summary judgment [Dkt. 22], filed on Friday, February 21, which advances \narguments concerning the Court\u2019s authority to impose equitable remedies for the first time before \nthis Court; plaintiff\u2019s forty-page opposition and cross motion for summary judgment, filed on \nMonday, February 24; defendants\u2019 reply, filed on February 25; and plaintiff\u2019s cross opposition, \nwhich is not due until tomorrow.  This is particularly true now that the motion for a preliminary \ninjunction has been consolidated with the merits, as defendants requested.   \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 27     Filed 02/26/25     Page 5 of 5\nAt the hearing, the Court solicited the parties\u2019 views on the matter.  Plaintiff agrees that a \nshort extension in accordance with the Federal Rules would be appropriate to facilitate full \nconsideration of the positions of the parties and the arguments made at the hearing.  He also noted \nthat once the Court ruled on the merits in a final, appealable order, the TRO would be vacated, and \nthe application would be moot.  While counsel for the defendants indicated a lack of familiarity \nwith the relevant legislative history and proposed to look into it as the subject of a supplemental \nfiling, she voiced defendants\u2019 objection to any extension of the TRO for the same reasons they \nopposed it in the first place.  \nIn consideration of all of these circumstances, then, the Court finds, pursuant to Rule \n65(b)(2), that there is good cause to extend the temporary restraining order for an additional three \ndays, through Saturday, March 1, so that the status quo will be preserved for the brief period of \ntime it takes to complete the written opinion on the consolidated motion for preliminary injunction \nand cross motions for summary judgment.   \nSO ORDERED. \n \nAMY BERMAN JACKSON \nUnited States District Judge \n \nDATE:  February 26, 2025 \n5\n\nClearinghouse file: https://clearinghouse-umich-production.s3.amazonaws.com/media/doc/156284.pdf\nExternal link: https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/69624836/27/dellinger-v-bessent/\nClearinghouse summary: clearinghouse.net/doc/156284"

The Remaining Factors Support A Stay ........................................25 \nCONCLUSION ..................................................................................................... 27 \nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE \nATTACHMENT: District Court\u2019s Memorandum Opinion and Order\n \n \n\nINTRODUCTION \nThe district court issued a permanent injunction countermanding the \nPresident\u2019s removal of Hampton Dellinger as the head of the Office of Spe-\ncial Counsel (OSC), and reinstating Dellinger as sole head of an executive \nagency.  The court assumed that Dellinger \u201chardly\u201d exercises any executive \npower at all.  Yet, since being reinstated, Dellinger has been prosecuting \ncomplaints on behalf of terminated federal employees and seeking stays of \ntheir terminations.  The Court should immediately stay the district court\u2019s \norder and put an end to Dellinger\u2019s rogue use of executive authority over \nthe President\u2019s objection. \nTwo prior appeals of orders countermanding Dellinger\u2019s removal\u2014\nfirst an \u201cadministrative stay,\u201d then a \u201ctemporary restraining order\u201d\u2014were \ndismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.  Now, this Court can indisputa-\nbly reach the merits.  Despite the district court\u2019s characterization of its order \nas \u201cextremely narrow\u201d (Dkt. 32 at 4, 65), it gravely offends the separation of \npowers.   \nAs the Supreme Court recently observed, \u201cCongress cannot act on, and \ncourts cannot examine, the President\u2019s actions on subjects within his \u2018con-\n \n\nclusive  and  preclusive\u2019  constitutional  authority\u201d\u2014including  \u201cthe  Presi-\ndent\u2019s \u2018unrestricted power of removal\u2019 with respect to \u2018executive officers of \nthe United States whom [the President] has appointed.\u2019\u201d Trump v. United \nStates, 603 U.S. 593, 609 (2024).  The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that \nArticle II empowers the President to remove at will the sole heads of execu-\ntive agencies.  In Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020), the Court inval-\nidated removal restrictions for the Director of the Consumer Financial Pro-\ntection Bureau (CFPB), and in Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220 (2021), it ex-\nplained that Seila Law was \u201call but dispositive\u201d regarding similar restrictions \nfor the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) Director, explaining that \n\u201c[t]he FHFA (like the CFPB) is an agency led by a single Director,\u201d id. at 250-\n251.  Consistent with those holdings, President Biden removed the Commis-\nsioner of Social Security in 2021, and the courts of appeals have sustained \nthe President\u2019s at-will removal authority.  Rodriguez v. SSA, 118 F.4th 1302, \n1313-1314 (11th Cir. 2024); Kaufmann v. Kijakazi, 32 F.4th 843, 848-849 (9th Cir. \n2022).   \nThe President\u2019s exercise here of the authority sustained in Seila Law \nand Collins should not have been constitutionally controversial.  Conversely, \n- 2 - \n\nthe district court\u2019s order is historically unprecedented and legally ground-\nless.  Plaintiff has identified no prior case in American history where a court \nhas forced the President to retain the sole head of an agency after the Presi-\ndent has determined that that person should not be entrusted with executive \npower.  Indeed, it is well established that courts lack equitable power to \u201cre-\nstrain an executive officer from making a \u2026 removal of a subordinate ap-\npointee.\u201d  White v. Berry, 171 U.S. 366, 377 (1898). \nThis Court should stay the order and grant an immediate administra-\ntive stay.  As Judge Katsas has explained, the government has \u201ca strong like-\nlihood of success on the merits\u201d; plaintiff\u2019s reinstatement irreparably \u201cim-\npinges on the \u2018conclusive and preclusive\u2019 power through which the Presi-\ndent controls the Executive Branch\u201d; and \u201ca stay would not substantially \nharm\u201d plaintiff.  Dellinger v. Bessent, 2025 WL 559669, at *14, *16-17 (D.C. Cir. \nFeb. 15, 2025) (Katsas, J., dissenting). \nThe parties have agreed upon an expedited schedule under which \nplaintiff would respond to this motion by noon Wednesday, March 5, and \ndefendants would reply by noon on Thursday, March 6.  Defendants respect-\nfully request a ruling from the Court as soon as practicable thereafter. \n- 3 - \n\nSTATEMENT \nA.  Statutory Background \n1.  Congress established OSC in the Civil Service Reform Act of \n1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat. 1111.  OSC began as the \u201cinvestigative and \nprosecutorial arm of the Merit Systems Protection Board\u201d (MSPB).  OSC, An-\nnual Report to Congress for Fiscal Year 2023, at 9, https://perma.cc/QGE8-\n25YE (OSC Annual Report).  Congress made OSC a freestanding agency in \n1989.  Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-12, 103 Stat. 16. \nOSC remains an \u201cinvestigative and prosecutorial agency.\u201d  OSC, About \nOSC, https://perma.cc/ANW6-LCEQ.  It enforces provisions of four stat-\nutes governing the federal workforce: the Civil Service Reform Act, which \nregulates the civil-service system; the Whistleblower Protection Act, which \nforbids reprisals against federal whistleblowers; the Hatch Act of 1939, Pub. \nL. No. 76-252, 53 Stat. 1147, which restricts political activity by federal em-\nployees;  and  the  Uniformed  Services  Employment  and  Reemployment \nRights Act of 1994, Pub. L. No. 103-353, 108 Stat. 3149, which forbids em-\nployment discrimination against servicemembers and veterans.  OSC prom-\nulgates regulations, investigates allegations of wrongdoing\u2014including by \n- 4 - \n\nissuing subpoenas and ordering depositions\u2014and brings disciplinary ac-\ntions.  5 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1212-1216. \n2.  OSC is \u201cheaded by the Special Counsel,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(a), who \nis appointed by the President, with the advice and consent of the Senate, for \na five-year term, see id. \u00a7 1211(b).  The Special Counsel has the statutory au-\nthority to appoint subordinate agency personnel, see id. \u00a7 1212(d), and the \nconstitutional authority to supervise those officials\u2019 exercise of executive \npower, see United States v. Arthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. 1, 13 (2021).   \nCongress provided that the Special Counsel \u201cmay be removed by the \nPresident only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d  5 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b).  But the Executive Branch has raised constitutional objec-\ntions to that restriction from the beginning.  During the Carter Administra-\ntion, the Department of Justice\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) explained \nthat \u201c[b]ecause the Special Counsel [would] be performing largely executive \nfunctions, the Congress [could] not restrict the President\u2019s power to remove \nhim.\u201d  2 Op. O.L.C. 120, 121 (1978); see Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 221 (noting this \n\u201ccontemporaneous constitutional objection\u201d).  And when Congress initially \nsought to establish OSC as a standalone executive agency and to increase its \npowers, President Reagan pocket-vetoed that legislation, explaining that it \n- 5 - \n\n\u201craised serious constitutional concerns\u201d by, inter alia, \u201cpurport[ing] to insu-\nlate the Office from presidential supervision and to limit the power of the \nPresident to remove his subordinates from office.\u201d  Public Papers of the Pres-\nidents, Ronald Reagan, Vol. II, Oct. 26, 1988, pp. 1391-1392 (1991); see Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 221 (citing this \u201cveto on constitutional grounds\u201d). \nPresident George H.W. Bush signed the statute that separated OSC \nfrom the MSPB, notwithstanding the restrictions on removal of the Special \nCounsel, and Presidents Clinton, Obama, and Trump signed subsequent leg-\nislation reauthorizing OSC or refining its powers.  See Dkt. 32 at 16-19.  But \nthe Executive Branch has not receded from its constitutional objection to re-\nstrictions on the removal of sole agency heads.  In 1994, for example, OLC \nadvised President Clinton \u201cthat the [Social Security Administration]\u2019s new \nstructure as an agency led by a single person with tenure protection was \u2018ex-\ntraordinary\u2019\u201d and that the tenure protection presented a \u201c\u2018serious constitu-\ntional question\u2019\u201d because it \u201c\u2018would severely erode the President\u2019s author-\nity.\u2019\u201d  Constitutionality of the Commissioner of Social Security\u2019s Tenure Protection, \n2021 WL 2981542, at *2 (O.L.C. July 8, 2021) (quoting Letter for Lloyd N. Cut-\nler, Counsel to the President, from Walter Dellinger, Assistant Attorney Gen-\neral, OLC (July 29, 1994)).  And when President Trump signed legislation \n- 6 - \n\nreauthorizing OSC, he \u201creiterate[d] the longstanding position of the execu-\ntive branch that\u201d the \u201cinsulat[ion] from the President\u2019s removal authority \u2026 \nof a principal officer like the Special Counsel raises serious constitutional \nconcerns.\u201d  Statement by President Donald J. Trump on H.R. 2810 (Dec. 12, \n2017), https://perma.cc/R6DP-P4SB. \nB.  This Litigation \nIn March 2024, President Biden, with the advice and consent of the \nSenate, appointed plaintiff to serve as Special Counsel.  Dkt. 1 \u00b6 1.  On Feb-\nruary 7, 2025, the Director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office \ninformed plaintiff that the President had removed him from office effective \nimmediately.  Id. \u00b6 2. \nOn February 10, plaintiff brought this suit to challenge his removal, \nDkt. 1, and sought a temporary restraining order (TRO), Dkt. 2.  The district \ncourt entered what it described as a \u201cbrief administrative stay\u201d that would \nlast for several days.  Feb. 10, 2025 Minute Order.  That order restored plain-\ntiff to office and enjoined defendants from \u201cdeny[ing] him access to the re-\nsources or materials of that office or recogniz[ing] the authority of any other \nperson as Special Counsel.\u201d  Id.  The next day, the President designated the \nSecretary of Veterans Affairs as Acting Special Counsel, but the district \n- 7 - \n\ncourt\u2019s order prevented that designation from becoming effective.  See Dkt. \n13 at 1. \nThe government appealed and sought mandamus and a stay.  This \nCourt dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, denied mandamus, and \ndismissed the stay motion.  Dellinger v. Bessent, 2025 WL 561425 (D.C. Cir. \nFeb. 12, 2025) (per curiam). \nOn February 12, the district court issued what it described as a TRO.  \nDkt. 14.  The order stated that plaintiff \u201cshall continue to serve as the Special \nCounsel\u201d and continued to bar interference with his service.  Id. at 26.  \nThe government again appealed, seeking mandamus and a stay.  This \nCourt dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction and denied relief.  2025 \nWL 559669 (per curiam).  Judge Katsas dissented, id. at *10-17, concluding \nthat the TRO was reviewable, that \u201c[t]he government ha[d] shown a strong \nlikelihood of success on the merits,\u201d and that \u201c[t]he remaining factors also \ncounsel[ed] in favor of a stay.\u201d  Id. at *14, *16.  \nThe government asked the Supreme Court to vacate the TRO.  That \nCourt held the government\u2019s application \u201cin abeyance until February 26, \nwhen the TRO [was] set to expire.\u201d  Bessent v. Dellinger, 2025 WL 580388, at \n*1 (U.S. Feb. 21, 2025).  Justices Sotomayor and Jackson would have denied \n- 8 - \n\nthe application.  Id.  Justices Gorsuch and Alito would have granted the ap-\nplication.  Id. at *1-3 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting).  Justice Gorsuch observed that, \nunder traditional principles, courts of equity lack the power to \u201c\u2018restrain an \nexecutive officer from making a \u2026 removal of a subordinate appointee.\u2019\u201d  Id. \nat *2 (quoting White, 171 U.S. at 377). \nC.  Plaintiff\u2019s Activities During This Litigation \nAfter  the  district  court  reinstated  him,  plaintiff  has  aggressively \nwielded OSC\u2019s executive powers during this litigation.  On the day of the \nSupreme  Court\u2019s  order,  plaintiff  filed  administrative  actions  before  the \nMSPB challenging agencies\u2019 removal of six probationary employees.  OSC, \nSpecial Counsel Dellinger Statement on Request that MSPB Stay Terminations of \nProbationary Employees (Feb. 24, 2025), https://perma.cc/TZ2Q-LAJ6.  Plain-\ntiff sought a 45-day stay of the removals while OSC \u201c\u2018continues to investi-\ngate\u2019\u201d  and  announced  that  he  \u201cis  considering  ways  to  seek  relief  for  a \nbroader group\u201d of employees.  Id.  An MSPB member granted the stay re-\nquest.    Order  (Feb.  25,  2025),  https://osc.gov/Documents/PPP/Formal\n%20Stays/Order%20on%20Stay%20Request%20(Redacted).pdf  (\u201cMSPB \nStay Order\u201d). \n- 9 - \n\nThe district court granted summary judgment to plaintiff on one count \nof his complaint (Dkt. 32) and entered a permanent injunction and declara-\ntory judgment (Dkt. 33) reinstating plaintiff to his position.  The court did \nnot dispute that plaintiff is a principal officer, and acknowledged that he ex-\nercises \u201csome executive responsibilities\u201d (Dkt. 32 at 48), but concluded that \nArticle II nonetheless permits Congress to restrict the President\u2019s power to \nremove him.  The court accordingly \u201cdeclared that plaintiff \u2026 is the Special \nCounsel,\u201d that his removal \u201cwas an unlawful, ultra vires act,\u201d and that he \n\u201cshall be the Special Counsel \u2026 for the remainder of his five-year term un-\nless and until he is removed in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b).\u201d  Dkt. 33 \nat 1.  And the court enjoined defendants, other than the President, from \u201cob-\nstruct[ing] or interfer[ing] with [plaintiff\u2019s] performance of his duties\u201d or \n\u201cdeny[ing] him the authority, benefits, or resources of his office,\u201d among \nother things.  Id. at 2.  The practical effect of the injunction and declaratory \njudgment is to render ineffectual the President\u2019s designation of a different \nofficial to occupy the position from which the President removed plaintiff. \n- 10 - \n\nARGUMENT \nThe government is likely to succeed on the merits, will be irreparably \ninjured absent a stay, and the balance of equities and public interest support \na stay.  See Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 426 (2009).1   \nA.  The Government Is Likely To Prevail On The Merits \nThe government is likely to prevail because the Constitution empow-\ners the President to remove sole agency heads, such as the Special Counsel, \nat will, and because the district court\u2019s order exceeds its remedial powers. \n1.  Article II empowers the President to remove the \nSpecial Counsel at will  \na.  Article II vests the \u201cexecutive Power\u201d in the President and di-\nrects him to \u201ctake Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\u201d  U.S. Const. \nart. II, \u00a7 1, cl. 1; id. \u00a7 3.  The executive power \u201cgenerally includes the ability \nto remove executive officials\u201d at will.  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 213.  The Presi-\ndent\u2019s power to remove those who exercise executive power on his behalf \n\u201cfollows from the text of Article II,\u201d \u201cwas settled by the First Congress,\u201d and \nhas been \u201cconfirmed\u201d repeatedly.  Id. at 204; see Trump, 603 U.S. at 620-621; \nCollins, 594 U.S. at 250-256; Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 213-232; Free Enterprise Fund \n \n1 The government requested a stay in district court per Federal Rule of \nAppellate Procedure 8(a) on March 1. \n- 11 - \n\nv. PCAOB, 561 U.S. 477, 492-510 (2010); Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52, \n108-176 (1926).  The removal power is \u201c\u2018conclusive and preclusive,\u2019\u201d mean-\ning that it \u201cmay not be regulated by Congress or reviewed by the courts.\u201d  \nTrump, 603 U.S. at 620-621.  \nWhatever the outer limits of the removal power, Supreme Court prec-\nedents clearly establish that the President may remove sole agency heads at \nwill.  Congress has sought to confer tenure protection on only four sole \nagency heads: the CFPB and FHFA Directors, the Social Security Commis-\nsioner, and the Special Counsel.  Courts have held that the former three are \nconstitutionally removable at will, and precedent forecloses a special excep-\ntion for the Special Counsel.   \nIn Seila Law, the Supreme Court held that Congress violated Article II \nby granting tenure protection to the CFPB Director.  591 U.S. at 220-232.  \n\u201cThe CFPB\u2019s single-Director structure,\u201d the Court explained, \u201ccontravene[d] \n[Article II\u2019s] carefully calibrated system by vesting significant governmental \npower in the hands of a single individual accountable to no one.\u201d  Id. at 224. \nIn Collins, the Court reached the same conclusion for the FHFA.  594 \nU.S. at 226-228.  The Court found Seila Law \u201call but dispositive\u201d since the \nFHFA was \u201can agency led by a single Director.\u201d  Id. at 250-251.  Declining to \n- 12 - \n\ntreat the FHFA differently because it exercised less executive power than \nCFPB, the Court explained that \u201cthe nature and breadth of an agency\u2019s au-\nthority is not dispositive\u201d; \u201c[t]he President\u2019s removal power serves vital pur-\nposes even when the officer subject to removal is not the head of one of the \nlargest and most powerful agencies\u201d; and\u201c[c]ourts are not well-suited to \nweigh the relative importance of the regulatory and enforcement authority \nof disparate agencies.\u201d  Id. at 251-253. \nFollowing Collins, President Biden removed the Social Security Com-\nmissioner without cause, notwithstanding 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 902(a)(3), which per-\nmitted removal only for neglect of duty or malfeasance in office.  In support-\ning that decision, OLC explained that \u201cthe best reading of Collins and Seila \nLaw\u201d is \u201cthat the President need not heed the Commissioner\u2019s statutory ten-\nure protection.\u201d  2021 WL 2981542, at *1, *7.  Those courts of appeals that \nhave considered that question have agreed.  See Rodriguez, 118 F.4th at 1313-\n1314; Kaufmann, 32 F.4th at 848-849.  \nb.  Crafting an exception to at-will removal for the Special Counsel \nwould contravene those precedents.  \u201c[T]he Special Counsel undoubtedly \nwields executive power.\u201d  2025 WL 559669, at *15 (Katsas, J., dissenting).  He \nmay, among other things, \u201cinvestigate allegations of prohibited personnel \n- 13 - \n\npractices,\u201d 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1212(a)(2); \u201cinvestigat[e]\u201d \u201cany allegation\u201d concerning \n\u201cpolitical activity,\u201d \u201cactivities prohibited by any civil service law,\u201d or \u201cpro-\nhibited discrimination,\u201d id. \u00a7 1216(a); and \u201cissue subpoenas\u201d and \u201corder \u2026 \ndepositions,\u201d  id.  \u00a7 1212(b)(2).    The  Special  Counsel  enforces  statutes  by \nbringing disciplinary actions and litigating complaints before the MSPB, see \nid. \u00a7 1215; intervening in MSPB proceedings, id. \u00a7 1212(c)(1); and litigating in \nfederal court as amicus curiae, id. \u00a7 1212(h)(1).  The Special Counsel also may \nappoint  other  officials,  see  id.  \u00a7 1212(d)(1),  and  issue  regulations,  see  id. \n\u00a7 1212(e).   \nThose are executive functions, and significant ones.  At the outset, OLC \nrecognized that \u201cthe Special Counsel\u2019s functions are executive in character\u201d; \nthat his powers \u201care directed at the enforcement of the laws\u201d; and that his \n\u201crole in investigating and prosecuting prohibited practices\u201d is comparable \nto that of the \u201cU.S. Attorney or other Federal prosecutors.\u201d  2 Op. O.L.C. at \n120.  This Court has likewise noted that the Special Counsel is a \u201c\u2018prosecutor\u2019 \n\u2026 of merit system abuses\u201d and that his administrative enforcement actions \nare \u201ccomparable to criminal prosecutions designed to vindicate the public \ninterest.\u201d  Frazier v. MSPB, 672 F.2d 150, 163 (D.C. Cir. 1982); see Barnhart v. \nDevine, 771 F.2d 1515, 1520 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (describing the Special Counsel \n- 14 - \n\nas the MSPB\u2019s \u201cprosecutorial arm\u201d).  The MSPB, too, has described the Spe-\ncial Counsel\u2019s relationship to it as like \u201c\u2018that of a prosecuting attorney to a \ncourt.\u2019\u201d  Layser v. USDA, 8 M.S.P.B. 72, 73 (1981).  And OSC agrees that it is \nan \u201cinvestigative and prosecutorial agency.\u201d  Supra p.4.  \u201cInvestigative and \nprosecutorial  decisionmaking  is  \u2018the  special  province  of  the  Executive \nBranch,\u2019 and the Constitution vests the entirety of the executive power in the \nPresident.\u201d  Trump, 603 U.S. at 620 (citation omitted).     \nc.  The district court framed the relevant question as whether \u201cSeila \nLaw or Collins compel[s] the conclusion that\u201d the Special Counsel\u2019s removal \nrestriction \u201cis unconstitutional\u201d (Dkt. 32 at 33; see id. at 65).  That gets things \nbackwards.  The Supreme Court\u2019s precedents recognize a \u201cgeneral rule\u201d of \n\u201cunrestricted removal,\u201d subject to only \u201ctwo exceptions.\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. \nat 215.  First, in Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), the \nCourt concluded that Congress could provide tenure protection to \u201ca multi-\nmember body of experts, balanced along partisan lines, that performed leg-\nislative and judicial functions and was said not to exercise any executive \npower.\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 216.  Second, the Court concluded that Con-\ngress could provide tenure protection to \u201ccertain inferior officers with nar-\nrowly defined duties.\u201d  Id. at 204 (citing Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988), \n- 15 - \n\nand United States v. Perkins, 116 U.S. 483 (1886)).  Those two exceptions rep-\nresent \u201c\u2018the outermost constitutional limits of permissible congressional re-\nstrictions on the President\u2019s removal power.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 218.  The relevant ques-\ntion, therefore, is whether the Special Counsel falls within either of those ex-\nceptions. \nIn any event, Seila Law and Collins do \u201ccompel the conclusion that\u201d the \nSpecial Counsel\u2019s removal restriction \u201cis unconstitutional\u201d (Dkt. 32 at 33) be-\ncause they establish a bright-line rule that \u201cthe Constitution prohibits even \n\u2018modest restrictions\u2019 on the President\u2019s power to remove the head of an \nagency with a single top officer.\u201d  Collins, 594 U.S. at 256.  The district court \nattempted to distinguish the precedents by focusing on the particularities of \nthe agencies at issue (e.g., Dkt. 32 at 34), much as the amicus defending the \nremoval restriction in Collins emphasized the ways in which \u201cthe FHFA\u2019s \nauthority [was] more limited than that of the CFPB,\u201d Collins, 594 U.S. at 251.  \nBut Collins rejected that mode of reasoning, emphasizing that the President\u2019s \npower to remove sole agency heads does not \u201chinge[] on\u201d \u201cthe relative im-\nportance of the regulatory and enforcement authority of disparate agencies.\u201d  \nId. at 253.  That is why Justices Breyer, Sotomayor, and Kagan understood \nthe majority opinion in Collins to mean that \u201c[a]ny \u2018agency led by a single \n- 16 - \n\nDirector,\u2019 no matter how much executive power it wields, now becomes sub-\nject to the requirement of at-will removal.\u201d  Id. at 273 (Kagan, J., concurring \nin part and concurring in the judgment); see id. at 292 (Sotomayor, J., joined \nby Breyer, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part) (\u201c[A]ll that matters \nis that \u2018[t]he FHFA (like the CFPB) is an agency led by a single Director.\u2019\u201d). \nThe district court characterized the Special Counsel\u2019s powers as insig-\nnificant.  Dkt. 32 at 39.  That is irrelevant and incorrect.  It is irrelevant be-\ncause there is no exception to the \u201cgeneral rule\u201d of \u201cunrestricted removal,\u201d \nSeila Law, 591 U.S. at 215, for the sole heads of agencies who exercise only \nlimited forms of executive power.  All such officers are removable at will\u2014\nand, as noted, the district court recognized that plaintiff exercises \u201csome ex-\necutive responsibilities\u201d (Dkt. 32 at 48; see id. at 5).  The analysis should have \nended there. \nBut the district court also erred in characterizing the Special Counsel\u2019s \npower.  The court plainly erred in stating that the Special Counsel \u201ccannot \nbring a complaint\u201d (Dkt. 32 at 5); that is what he does when he petitions the \nMSPB.    Because  the  Special  Counsel  can  obtain  corrective  action  only \nthrough such petitions (id. at 39), he is a prosecutor rather than an adjudica-\n- 17 - \n\ntor, but prosecution is quintessentially an executive power.  And as plain-\ntiff\u2019s recent conduct reflects, the Special Counsel\u2019s MSPB litigation can itself \nhave significant consequences.  When plaintiff sought a stay of removals of \nprobationary employees, he told the MSPB that it \u201cmust grant [his] request \nfor a stay unless [his] claim [was] \u2018inherently unreasonable,\u2019\u201d U.S. Special \nCounsel\u2019s Initial Request for Stay of Personnel Actions at 19, U.S. Office of \nSpecial Counsel ex rel. Former Employee v. Department of Veterans Affairs (MSPB \nFeb.  21,  2025),  https://osc.gov/Documents/PPP/Formal%20Stays/\nStay%20Request%20(VA)%20Redacted.pdf,  and  the  MSPB  member  who \ngranted his request agreed with that required \u201c[d]eference\u201d to the Special \nCounsel, MSPB Stay Order, supra, at 3. \nThe district court emphasized that \u201c[t]he Special Counsel is supposed \nto withstand the winds of political change.\u201d  Dkt. 32 at 49.  But that could be \nsaid of any official on whom Congress confers removal protection, and in-\ndeed it has been said in cases holding removal protections unconstitutional.  \nSee, e.g., Collins, 594 U.S. at 285 (Sotomayor, J., concurring in part and dis-\nsenting in part); Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 264 (Kagan, J., dissenting); Free Enter-\nprise, 561 U.S. at 522 (Breyer, J., dissenting).  If Congress\u2019s desire to insulate \n- 18 - \n\nan office from \u201cthe winds of political change\u201d were sufficient to override the \nPresident\u2019s removal power, then the power would be meaningless. \n2.  A court lacks the power to issue equitable relief re-\nstoring a removed officer \nThe government is also likely to prevail because the district court\u2019s or-\nder exceeded its remedial powers. \na.  Federal courts derive their equitable powers from the Judiciary \nAct of 1789, ch. 20, 1 Stat. 73.  See Grupo Mexicano de Desarrollo, S.A. v. Alliance \nBond Fund, Inc., 527 U.S. 308, 318 (1999).  They must exercise those powers in \naccordance with \u201c\u2018traditional principles of equity jurisdiction,\u2019\u201d as under-\nstood at the Founding.  Id. at 319. \nOne well-established principle of equity is that a court may not enjoin \nthe removal of an executive officer.  In White v. Berry, for example, the Su-\npreme Court reversed an injunction preventing the removal of a federal rev-\nenue officer who had been appointed by the Secretary of the Treasury.  The \nCourt explained that \u201c\u2018a court of equity will not, by injunction, restrain an \nexecutive officer from making a wrongful removal of a subordinate appoin-\ntee, nor restrain the appointment of another.\u2019\u201d  171 U.S. at 377.  The Court \n- 19 - \n\nhas reaffirmed that principle.  See Baker v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 231 (1962); Wal-\nton v. House of Representatives, 265 U.S. 487, 490 (1924); Harkrader v. Wadley, \n172 U.S. 148, 165 (1898); In re Sawyer, 124 U.S. 200, 212 (1888).   \nThe same principle forecloses declaratory relief.  A declaratory-judg-\nment suit is \u201c\u2018essentially an equitable cause of action.\u2019\u201d  Samuels v. Mackell, \n401 U.S. 66, 70 (1971).  And the Declaratory Judgment Act \u201cwas not devised \nto deprive courts of \u2026 their freedom to withhold relief upon established eq-\nuitable principles.\u201d  Great Lakes Dredge & Dock Co. v. Huffman, 319 U.S. 293, \n300 (1943).  For that reason, Samuels \u201cheld that interference with pending \nstate criminal prosecutions by declaratory judgments is subject to the same \nrestrictions curbing federal interference by injunction,\u201d Perez v. Ledesma, 401 \nU.S. 82, 86 n.2 (1971), and Great Lakes held the same as to interference with \n\u201cthe collection of state taxes,\u201d 319 U.S. at 299. \nThose principles carry added force when, as here, a district court en-\njoins the President\u2019s removal of an agency head.  A court \u201chas no jurisdiction \nof a bill to enjoin the President in the performance of his official duties.\u201d  \nMississippi v. Johnson, 71 U.S. (4 Wall.) 475, 501 (1867).  Courts have likewise \n\u201cnever submitted the President to declaratory relief.\u201d  Newdow v. Roberts, 603 \n- 20 - \n\nF.3d 1002, 1013 (D.C. Cir. 2010).  The district court\u2019s order violates those prin-\nciples.  Whether expressly directed at the President or not, an order reinstat-\ning an executive officer removed by the President violates Article II. \nWe are unaware of any previous case in which a court enjoined the \nPresident\u2019s removal of the sole head of an agency.  A district court in 1983 \neffectively reinstated removed members of the multimember U.S. Commis-\nsion on Civil Rights, but that court believed the commission functioned as a \n\u201c\u2018legislative agency\u2019\u201d whose \u201c\u2018only  purpose\u2019\u201d  was  \u201c\u2018to  find  facts which \n[could] subsequently be used as a basis for legislative or executive action\u2019\u201d\u2014\nnot to exercise executive power in its own right.  Berry v. Reagan, 1983 WL \n538, at *2 (D.D.C. Nov. 14, 1983). \nOfficers may challenge their removal, and federal courts may adjudi-\ncate their claims\u2014but historically, those suits have sought legal remedies \nsuch as back pay, mandamus, and quo warranto, rather than equitable rem-\nedies such as injunctions.  Most prior removal cases involve back-pay claims.  \nSee Wiener v. United States, 357 U.S. 349, 350 (1958); Humphrey\u2019s Executor, 295 \nU.S. at 618; Myers, 272 U.S. at 106; Shurtleff v. United States, 189 U.S. 311, 318 \n(1903); Parsons v. United States, 167 U.S. 324, 326 (1897); Perkins, 116 U.S. at \n483.  In some cases, individuals have sought mandamus to contest title to \n- 21 - \n\nnon-executive offices.  See Ex parte Hennen, 38 U.S. (13 Pet.) 230, 256 (1839) \n(court clerk); Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 167-168 (1803) (jus-\ntice of the peace).  And the Supreme Court has identified quo warranto as a \n\u201cremedy for trying the title to office.\u201d  Delgado v. Chavez, 140 U.S. 586, 590 \n(1891). \nThose legal remedies come with guardrails that equitable remedies \nlack.  Back-pay claims do not allow a plaintiff to exercise executive power \nover the President\u2019s objection.  A mandamus plaintiff must show a \u201cclear\u201d \nright to relief.  Heckler v. Ringer, 466 U.S. 602, 616 (1984).  And a quo warranto \nplaintiff must satisfy various procedural requirements, such as securing the \napproval of the Attorney General, U.S. Attorney, or court before suing.  See \nD.C. Code \u00a7\u00a7 16-3501 to 16-3503; Andrade v. Lauer, 729 F.2d 1475, 1497-1498 \n(D.C. Cir. 1984).   \nb.  The district court failed to square its order with these precedents. \nFirst, the court suggested that a declaratory judgment is \u201ca legal rem-\nedy\u201d not \u201csubject to the traditional limits on the Court\u2019s equitable authority \nto enjoin the President.\u201d  Dkt. 32 at 55-56.  That is incorrect as explained \nabove (at pp.20-21). \n- 22 - \n\nSecond, the court relegated to a footnote its response to White v. Berry\u2014\nand the principal response was that plaintiff was \u201cnot requesting an order \nthat anyone be removed or reinstated.\u201d  Dkt. 32 at 59 n.25.  That assertion is \ndifficult to understand.  Plaintiff was removed on February 7, brought this \nsuit three days later, and the district court has now declared that he \u201cis the \nSpecial Counsel.\u201d  Dkt. 33 at 1.  The court failed to explain how that is not \n\u201creinstate[ment].\u201d \nThe court also stated that its equitable relief bore \u201cparallels to remedies \nthat have been awarded in the past.\u201d  Dkt. 32 at 59 n.25.  But those were legal, \nnot equitable, remedies, see White, 171 U.S. at 377, and the merger of law and \nequity did not expand district courts\u2019 equitable powers beyond their tradi-\ntional scope, see Grupo Mexicano, 327 U.S. at 318-319.  The court described \nplaintiff\u2019s \u201cprayer for relief\u201d as \u201csufficiently broad to encompass a request \nfor\u201d a writ of quo warranto \u201cor another form of relief if recharacterizing it is \nnecessary\u201d to avoid constraints on the equity power.  Dkt. 32 at 59 n.25.  But \nas discussed above, quo warranto (like other legal relief) comes with con-\nstraints plaintiff has not satisfied.  And the availability of an alternative legal \nremedy does not justify equitable relief contrary to Supreme Court prece-\ndent. \n- 23 - \n\nFinally, the district court relied heavily on Swan v. Clinton, 100 F.3d 973 \n(D.C. Cir. 1996), and Severino v. Biden, 71 F.4th 1038 (D.C. Cir. 2023).  Dkt. 32 \nat 57-58.  But those decisions do not bear the weight the district court placed \non them.  In neither case did this Court review, much less sustain, an order \nlike this.  Rather, the Court considered only its jurisdiction over an official\u2019s \nchallenge to his removal.  In both cases, the Court held that even a prospect \nof \u201cpartial relief\u201d can establish redressability, and thus jurisdiction.  Swan, \n100 F.3d at 980-981; see Severino, 71 F.4th at 1042-1043.  In both cases, the \nCourt recognized that such relief\u2014an order directing subordinate officials \nto treat the officer as not having been removed\u2014might not ultimately be \navailable if plaintiff were to prevail on the merits.  In Swan, the Court recog-\nnized that the President could \u201cundercut [the] relief\u201d were he \u201cto insist that\u201d \nhis preferred replacement \u201coccupy the position,\u201d 100 F.3d at 980-981, and in \nSeverino, the Court noted other potential obstacles and relied on the fact that \n\u201cat the motion to dismiss stage,\u201d the plaintiff needed only to \u201cplausibly al-\nlege that relief could be afforded,\u201d 71 F.4th at 1043.  Swan and Severino may \nestablish jurisdiction here, but they cannot justify the relief the district court \nentered. \n- 24 - \n\nB.  The Remaining Factors Support A Stay \n1.  The district court\u2019s order causes extraordinary harm to the Pres-\nident, in whom the Constitution vests \u201call of\u200a\u201d \u201cthe \u2018executive Power.\u2019\u201d  Seila \nLaw, 590 U.S. at 203.  The order forces the President to continue allowing an \nagency head to exercise executive power, even though the President already \nremoved that agency head.  That sort of harm\u2014to the Executive Branch, to \nthe separation of powers, and to our democratic system\u2014is irreparable.  \nThat harm is particularly concrete here.  As noted above (at pp.9-10), \nsince the district court\u2019s reinstatement, plaintiff has brought multiple pro-\nceedings before the MSPB seeking to halt the dismissal of other federal em-\nployees.  And plaintiff has announced that \u201cOSC will continue to pursue \nallegations of unlawful personnel actions, which can include asking MSPB \nfor relief for a broader group of fired probationary employees.\u201d  OSC, MSPB \nGrants Stays of Probationary Employee Terminations (Feb. 25, 2025), https://\nperma.cc/CTR6-7Q7P.  Plaintiff\u2019s exercise of executive powers contrary to \nthe President\u2019s wishes, leading to an order restraining other executive ac-\ntions that are consistent with the President\u2019s wishes\u2014and his threat to con-\ntinue in this vein\u2014underscore the gravity and irreparable character of the \nongoing harm that the district court\u2019s order is causing. \n- 25 - \n\n2.  Conversely, a stay would not irreparably harm plaintiff or the \npublic interest.  Although removal affects plaintiff\u2019s employment and salary, \nsuch consequences ordinarily do not constitute irreparable injury.  Sampson v. \nMurray, 415 U.S. 61, 92 n.68 (1974).  Thus, the traditional remedy for such \nclaims has been back pay at the end of the case, not interim reinstatement.  \nSee 2025 WL 559669, at *17 (Katsas, J., dissenting).  \nThe district court concluded that plaintiff is irreparably harmed by his \ninability \u201cto fulfill\u201d the \u201cduty\u201d with which he was charged upon his appoint-\nment (Dkt. 32 at 61).  But that duty is vested in plaintiff\u2019s former office, not \nin plaintiff personally.  Plaintiff has no personal right to exercise the powers \nof an office after he has been removed. \n- 26 - \n\nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should stay the district court\u2019s order pending appeal and \nshould issue an immediate administrative stay. \nRespectfully submitted, \n  YAAKOV M.

A to Compl. [Dkt. # 1-1] (\u201cEx. A\u201d).   \nAs of the close of the business day on February 7, 2025, plaintiff Hampton Dellinger was \nthe Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel, having been appointed to a five-year term \nby the President of the United States and confirmed by the United States Senate.  In that position, \nhe served as the head of the small independent agency tasked with shielding federal employees \nfrom prohibited personnel practices, including retaliation for whistleblowing, in the workplace.  \n  At 7:22 p.m. that evening, he received the email message above from Sergio N. Gor, \nAssistant to the President, Director of Presidential Personnel Office, The White House, with no \nadditional explanation or reasoning. \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 2 of 67\nOn Monday, February 10, 2025, plaintiff filed this action to assert his entitlement to the \nposition of Special Counsel and prevent the defendants from interfering with or removing him \nfrom that role.  See Compl. [Dkt. # 1].  He sued Scott Bessent, in his official capacity as Secretary \nof the Treasury; Sergio Gor, in his official capacity as Director of the White House Presidential \nPersonnel Office; Karen Gorman, in her official capacity as Principal Deputy Special Counsel; \nKarl Kammann, in his official capacity as the Chief Operating Officer of the Office of Special \nCounsel; Donald J. Trump, in his official capacity as President of the United States; and Russell \nVought, in his official capacity as Director of the Office of Management and Budget.  See Compl. \nat 1.    \nAt the same time, plaintiff moved for a temporary restraining order to enjoin the effort to \nterminate him.  Pl.\u2019s Mot. for a TRO [Dkt. # 2] (\u201cMot. for TRO\u201d).  The proceedings and rulings \nthat followed will be set out in detail below.  For purposes of this introduction, it is important to \nadd that plaintiff later moved for a motion for preliminary injunction as well, and the Court \nscheduled a hearing.  In the interim, with the parties\u2019 consent, the Court consolidated the motion \nfor a preliminary injunction with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 65(b).  See Minute Order (Feb. 15, 2025). \nOn February 21, defendants moved for summary judgment in their favor.  Defs.\u2019 Mot. for \nSumm. J. [Dkt. # 22] (\u201cDefs.\u2019 Mot.\u201d).  On February 24, plaintiff filed a combined opposition to \ndefendants\u2019 motion, cross-motion for summary judgment on Count 1, and motion for permanent \ninjunction.  Pl.\u2019s Cross-Mot. for Summ. J. and Permanent Inj. and Opp. to Defs.\u2019 Mot.

The motions are fully briefed,1 and on February 26, the Court held a lengthy hearing \non the consolidated motions.  See Minute Entry (Feb. 26, 2025).   \nThere is no dispute that the statute establishing the Office of Special Counsel provides that \nthe Special Counsel may be removed by the President only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or \nmalfeasance in office, and that the curt email from the White House informing the Special Counsel \nthat he was terminated contained no reasons whatsoever.  This is the basis for Count 1, which \nalleges that the termination was an unlawful, ultra vires action, and the basis for plaintiff\u2019s \nassertion that he is entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 37\u201341.  The Court will \ngrant plaintiff\u2019s motion and enter judgment in his favor.2 \n  Defendants take the position that the statutory provision is unconstitutional and should be \nstruck down rather than enforced.  They insist that the President of the United States must have \ncontrol over the head of this small federal agency, as he does over all administrative agencies, \nnotwithstanding its narrow focus and its negligible impact on private actors or any sector of the \neconomy.  Plaintiff does not disagree with that.  Congress did not disagree with that.  It enshrined \nPresidential control in the statute by providing that he may remove the Special Counsel for the \n \n1   On February 25, defendants filed a combined reply in support of their summary judgment \nmotion and opposition to plaintiff\u2019s cross-motion.  Defs.\u2019 Reply in Supp. of Defs.\u2019 Mot. and Resp. \nin Opp. to Pl.\u2019s Mot. [Dkt. # 25] (\u201cDefs.\u2019 Reply\u201d).  On February 27, plaintiff filed his combined \nreply in support of his cross-motion and opposition to the government\u2019s motion for summary \njudgment.  See Reply in Supp. of Pl.\u2019s Mot. and Opp. to Defs.\u2019 Mot. [Dkt. # 29] (\u201cPl.\u2019s Reply\u201d).     \n \n2   Given  that  determination,  the  Court  need  not  reach  Count  Two,  Compl.  \u00b6\u00b6  42\u201343, \npredicated on the Administrative Procedure Act, or Count Four predicated on the constitutional \nseparation of powers and the Take Care Clause.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 46\u201347.  The other counts \u2013 Count \nThree for declaratory judgment, Count Five for writ of mandamus, and Count Six for injunctive \nrelief \u2013 relate to the remedies sought.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 44\u201345, 48\u201350, 51\u201352.  The ruling also means that \ndefendants\u2019 motion for summary judgment will be denied. \n3 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 4 of 67\nthree relatively broad, but specified reasons.  Defendants maintain, though, that the Constitution \ndemands that the President should have unfettered authority to fire him for no reason at all.  \nIn short, the question presented in this case is whether it is an unconstitutional intrusion on \nthe President\u2019s Article II powers to say that he may remove the Special Counsel for reasons related \nto his performance, but he cannot do it on a whim or out of personal animus.  It is an extremely \nnarrow question with little or no precedential value given the sui generis nature of the Office of \nSpecial Counsel, and the fact that there is no longer any other agency with a single head, protected \nby similar restrictions, in the executive branch.  \nThe Court finds that the statute is not unconstitutional.  And it finds that the elimination of \nthe restrictions on plaintiff\u2019s removal would be fatal to the defining and essential feature of the \nOffice of Special Counsel as it was conceived by Congress and signed into law by the President:  \nits independence.  The Court concludes that they must stand.   \nA review of both the statutory provisions setting out the powers and functions of the Office \nof Special Counsel, and the history of the legislation establishing the Special Counsel\u2019s position \nand the terms of his tenure, reveals that his independence is inextricably intertwined with the \nperformance of his duties.  The Special Counsel\u2019s job is to look into and expose unethical or \nunlawful practices directed at federal civil servants, and to help ensure that whistleblowers who \ndisclose fraud, waste, and abuse on the part of government agencies can do so without suffering \nreprisals.  It would be ironic, to say the least, and inimical to the ends furthered by the statute if \nthe Special Counsel himself could be chilled in his work by fear of arbitrary or partisan removal. \nMoreover, striking down the removal provision in the statute is not necessary for any of \nthe reasons that have animated the invalidation of similar restrictions in the past.  This Court\u2019s \nruling that the attempt to terminate the Special Counsel was unlawful is entirely consistent with \n4 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 5 of 67\nthe decisions reached and the legal framework set forth in the Supreme Court\u2019s most recent \nopinions on this subject:  Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Collins v. \nYellen.   \nFirst, those cases do not require a finding that the removal protections on the Special \nCounsel are unconstitutional because they expressly acknowledge that the Office of Special \nCounsel is not at all comparable to the agencies they were addressing.   \nSecond, and more importantly, this case does not present the affront to the President\u2019s \nArticle II authority that those did.  What troubled the Court in both Seila Law and Collins were \nrestrictions on the President\u2019s ability to remove an official who wields significant executive \nauthority.  The Special Counsel simply does not.  He cannot bring a case in court on behalf of the \nUnited States, impose a disciplinary sanction on behalf of the United States, demand payment on \nbehalf of the United States, promulgate a regulation on behalf of the United States, or issue a \ndecision on behalf of the United States.  While he may perform some typically executive functions, \nsuch as conducting investigations, he has no power to enforce his own subpoenas or to overcome \nother agencies\u2019 objections to his requests for records.  If an inquiry reveals wrongdoing, he cannot \nbring  a  complaint  or  call  for  corrective  action  himself;  he  must  petition  a  multi-headed \nquasi-judicial agency, or the appropriate administrative agency under Presidential control itself, to \n \ndo so.  They are free to turn him down.  \nThe  Special  Counsel  acts  as  an  ombudsman,  a  clearinghouse  for  complaints  and \nallegations, and after looking into them, he can encourage the parties to resolve the matter among \nthemselves.  But if that fails, he must direct them elsewhere.  And along the way, while he is \nrequired to inform the President of certain findings, the statute also specifically directs him to \nreport directly to Congress. \n5 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 6 of 67\nThis is not significant executive authority.  It is hardly executive authority at all. \nFinally, the underlying assumption of Seila Law and Collins is that a President necessarily \noperates through his executive agencies as he performs his duty to take care that the laws are \nfaithfully executed.  Therefore, the President must be able to not only choose, but also remove, \nagency heads, because their jobs entail serving as an extension of his own executive authority. \nPlaintiff does not take issue with that proposition either.  But he maintains that the Special Counsel \nis unique in that he cannot be characterized in that manner.  The Office of Special Counsel is not \nassigned responsibilities that include furthering the administration\u2019s agenda; it is the Special \nCounsel\u2019s job to look into and shine light on a set of specific prohibited practices so that the other \nbodies, in the appropriate exercise of their constitutional authority, can take whatever action they \ndeem to be appropriate.  To do this as Congress intended that he should, he must remain entirely \nfree of partisan or political influence, and that is why the statute survives scrutiny even under the \nmost recent precedent. \nIn sum, it would be antithetical to the very existence of this particular government agency \nand position to vindicate the President\u2019s Article II power as it was described in Humphrey\u2019s \nExecutor:  a constitutional license to bully officials in the executive branch into doing his will.   \n  For those reasons and the reasons stated below, plaintiff\u2019s cross-motion for summary \njudgment [Dkt.  # 23] will be  GRANTED, and defendants\u2019 motion  for summary judgment \n[Dkt. # 22] will be DENIED.     \n \n \n \n \n6 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 7 of 67\nBACKGROUND \nA.  Legislative History \nThe Special Counsel is the head of the Office of Special Counsel (\u201cOSC\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1211(a), an independent agency of the United States with a century-old origin and a history of \nfulfilling its statutory function spanning twelve presidential administrations.   \nThe OSC was created within the context of the laws that first established the concept of a \ncorps of federal civil servants and, over time, defined their rights and obligations.  This began with \nthe Pendleton Civil Service Act of 1883 (\u201cPendleton Act\u201d), 22 Stat. 403 (1883),3 which created a \n\u201cclassified\u201d federal civil service and \u201crequired competitive examination for entry into that service.\u201d \nArnett v. Kennedy, 416 U.S. 134, 149 (1974).  For almost a century before the Pendleton Act, \n\u201cfederal employment was regarded as an item of patronage, which could be granted, withheld, or \nwithdrawn for whatever reasons might appeal to the responsible executive hiring officer.\u201d  Id. at \n148.  The resulting spoils system was \u201coften . . . treated as a method of rewarding support at the \npolls,\u201d Hampton v. Mow Sun Wong, 426 U.S. 88, 107 (1976), and that gave rise to a federal \nworkforce where employees were selected and advanced based on political or personal favoritism, \nrather than competence.  S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 2\u20133 (1978). \n \n3   The National Archives has transcribed the full text of the Pendleton Act, which can be \nfound  at  Pendleton  Act  (1883),  Nat\u2019l  Archive  (last  reviewed  Feb.  8,  2022), \nhttps://www.archives.gov/milestone-documents/pendleton-\nact#:~:text=Approved%20on%20January%2016%2C%201883%2C%20the%20Pendleton%20A\nct,passed%20the%20Pendleton%20Act%20in%20January%20of%201883. \n \n7 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 8 of 67\nGrowing \u201csentiment for \u2018Civil Service reform\u2019\u201d in the wake of the Civil War and the \nsubsequent assassination of President James A.

As the \nSenate Report on the legislation described: \nThe single, simple, fundamental, pivotal idea of the whole bill is, that \nwhenever, hereafter, a new appointment or a promotion shall be made in the \nsubordinate  civil  service  in  the  departments  or  larger  offices,  such \nappointment or promotion shall be given to the man who is best fitted to \ndischarge the duties of the position, and that such fitness shall be ascertained \nby open, fair, honest, impartial competitive examination. The impartiality \nof those examinations is to be secured by every possible safeguard. They \nare to be open to all who choose to present themselves.

No. 95-969, at 4, the \nPendleton Act created the United States Civil Service Commission (\u201cCommission\u201d), consisting of \nthree commissioners appointed by the President.  22 Stat. 403.  \u201cThe Commission\u2019s job was to \nscreen, examine, and present a choice of applicants to fill jobs in the agencies.\u201d  S.

The Commission also aided the President in \u201cpreparing suitable rules\u201d for the federal civil \nservice, which, as Congress directed, were to include:  (1) \u201cno person in the public service \n \n4   According to the Supreme Court in Arnett v.

Id. at 5.  \nAlthough the Commission was not originally intended to be a \u201ccentral personnel agency,\u201d over \ntime, it had \u201cassumed full [administrative] responsibility\u201d over the vast majority of the federal \nworkforce.

Id. at 1\u20132.  On March 2, 1978, President Carter sent a letter to Congress with \nhis proposal for \u201ca comprehensive program to reform the Federal Civil Service system,\u201d intended \n9 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 10 of 67\nto \u201cincrease the government\u2019s efficiency\u201d while \u201censuring that employees and the public are \nprotected against political abuse of the system.\u201d  President Jimmy Carter, Federal Civil Service \nMessage to Congress (Mar. 2, 1978) (\u201cPresident Carter Letter\u201d).5  Among other things, he \nproposed to replace the Civil Service Commission with two agencies:  (1) the Office of Personnel \nManagement, which would be the \u201ccenter for personnel  administration\u201d; and (2) the Merit \nProtection Board, which would be \u201cthe adjudicatory arm of the new personnel system.\u201d  Id.  As \npart of the Merit Protection Board, President Carter proposed the creation of a \u201cSpecial Counsel,\u201d \nwho  would  \u201cinvestigate  and  prosecute  political  abuses  and  merit  system  violations,\u201d  and \n\u201csafeguard the rights\u201d of employees who \u201c\u2018blow the whistle\u2019 on violations of laws.\u201d  Id.  In his \nletter, President Carter emphasized the need for \u201cindependent and impartial protection\u201d for federal \nemployees.

As the Senate Report detailing the Act\u2019s history describes, Congress adopted President \nCarter\u2019s recommendation by \u201cprovid[ing] for an independent merit systems protection board and \nspecial counsel to adjudicate employee appeals and protect the merit system.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 95-\n969, at 2.  Both entities were intended to protect employees from \u201cimproper political influences or \npersonal favoritism in the recruiting, hiring, promotion, or dismissal processes,\u201d and \u201cto protect \nindividuals who speak out about government wrongdoing from reprisals.\u201d  Id. at 18.

As part of the MSPB, the Special Counsel would \n\u201creceive and investigate allegations of prohibited personnel practices in violation of the merit \nsystem,\u201d with a \u201cmandate to . . . prevent reprisals against government \u2018whistle blowers.\u2019\u201d  Id.   \nThe whistleblower mandate was particularly important to Congress: \nProtecting  employees  who  disclose  government  illegality,  waste,  and \ncorruption is a major step toward a more effective civil service.  In the vast \nfederal bureaucracy it is not difficult to conceal wrongdoing provided that \nno one summons the courage to disclose the truth.  Whenever misdeeds take \nplace in a federal agency, there are employees who know that it has \noccurred, and who are outraged by it.  What is needed is a means to assure \nthem that they will not suffer if they help uncover and correct administrative \nabuses.  What is needed is a means to protect the Pentagon employee who \ndiscloses billions of dollars in cost overruns, the GSA employee who \ndiscloses widespread fraud, and the nuclear engineer who questions the \nsafety of certain nuclear plants.  These conscientious civil servants deserve \nstatutory protection rather than bureaucratic harassment and intimidation.   \n \nId. at 8.   \n \nGiven their roles, Congress intended the MSPB and the Special Counsel to be \u201cindependent \nof any control or direction by the President.\u201d  Id. at 24.  But the legislators struggled to define the \nSpecial Counsel.  The original draft of the CSRA set a seven-year term limit for the Special \nCounsel, id. at 29, the same term length as members of the MSPB.  Id. at 28.  Believing that a \nseven-year term \u201cwas too long,\u201d Congress later amended the term to a four-year term coterminous \nwith the President, id., which matched President Carter\u2019s proposed legislation.  Reorganization \nPlan No. 2 of 1978, 43 Fed. Reg. 36037, 36039 (Aug. 15, 1978).  But Congress noted the need for \na for-cause removal restriction on the Special Counsel, explaining: \nBecause the Special Counsel may be called upon to investigate prohibited \npersonnel  practices  in  the  executive  branch,  and  to  bring  disciplinary \nactions against executive branch officials, the Committee believed it is \nessential that the Special Counsel be independent of presidential direction \nand control.  Accordingly, subsection (b) was added by the Committee to \n11 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 12 of 67\nprovide that the Special Counsel may be removed by the president only for \ninefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office. \n \nS. Rep. No. 95-969, at 29.   \n \nThe debate did not stop there.  Senators Charles Mathias (R-Md.) and Ted Stevens \n(R-Alaska) took issue with a shortened term, arguing: \n \n[The Special Counsel] would be responsible for investigating prohibited \npersonnel practices and prosecuting those who commit such practices.  \nAppointed by the President with the consent of the Senate to serve during \nthe president\u2019s term, he would be, and would be perceived as being, a \npolitical appointee serving at the pleasure of the administration.  How then \nwould  it  be  possible  for  the  special  counsel  to  initiate,  thoroughly \ninvestigate, and then take actions which by their very nature could prove \nembarrassing to the administration?  To be effective and to enjoy the \nconfidence of the people, the Special Counsel must be insulated from overt \nand subtle influences of the president and his appointees.  \nId. at 134.  And, on the other side, there was objection to the for-cause removal restriction on the \nSpecial Counsel\u2019s position.  Commenting on a draft of the CSRA that included the seven-year \nterm, the Office of Legal Counsel (\u201cOLC\u201d) issued an opinion that Congress could \u201cnot properly \nlimit\u201d the President\u2019s power to remove the Special Counsel because his functions were \u201cexecutive \nin character.\u201d  Mem. Op. for the Gen. Couns., Civ. Serv. Comm\u2019n, 2 Op. O.L.C. 120, 120 (1978).  \nThe OLC pointed in particular to the Special Counsel\u2019s \u201crole in investigating and prosecuting \nprohibited  practices,\u201d  equating  the  position  to  \u201cthat  of  a  U.S.  attorney  or  other  Federal \nprosecutors.\u201d  Id. at 120. \nDespite the OLC\u2019s opinion, the view of Senators Mathias and Stevens eventually carried \nthe day.  The final version of the Civil Services Reform Act passed by Congress created the \n\u201cSpecial Counsel of the Merits Systems Protection Board\u201d to serve a five-year term with removal \nonly for cause.

See U.S. Const, art. I, \u00a7 7, cl. 2.  When a bill passed by both houses of Congress reaches the \nPresident, if he does not sign it within ten days of its passage, it automatically becomes law.  Id.  \nBut if Congress adjourns within that ten-day period and the President does not sign the bill, the \nlaw is automatically vetoed, and this is referred to as a \u201cpocket veto.\u201d  Id.      \n15 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 16 of 67\nfrom  \u201creview[ing] . . .

Rec. 5036 (1989) (statement of Rep. Frank Thornton).  The Act\u2019s sponsors \u201cwork[ed] with \nAttorney General Thornburgh to remove the executive branch\u2019s misgivings about\u201d the bill, 135 \nCong. Rec. 4516 (1989) (statement of Sen. William Cohen), while retaining \u201cthe same strong \nprotections\u201d for whistleblowers.  135 Cong. Rec. 5036 (1989) (statement of Sen. Frank Thorton).  \nTo address the President\u2019s constitutional concern, Congress \u201cagreed to make the changes requested \nby the administration to clip the Special Counsel\u2019s wings.\u201d  135 Cong. Rec. 5037 (1989) (statement \nof Rep. Pat Schroeder).  Specifically, Congress agreed to \u201cdelete provisions . . . that would give \nthe Special Counsel the authority to go to court to appeal MSPB decisions and enforce subpoenas,\u201d \nand to \u201cdrop the provision . . . that would authorize the Special Counsel to appeal MSPB decisions \nto the Federal circuit court.\u201d  135 Cong. Rec. 4509 (1989) (statement of Sen. Carl Levin).  At the \nsame time, the law, as originally envisioned, removed the OSC from its place within the MSPB, \nestablished it as an independent agency, and retained the for-cause removal protection for the \nSpecial Counsel.  Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, Pub. L. 101-12, 103 Stat. 16 (1989). \n  On March 3, 1989, Attorney General Thornburgh sent a letter to the sponsor of the Act, \nSenator Carl Levin (D-Mich.), confirming the administration\u2019s support of the revised bill and \n \nthanking him \u201cfor his efforts in working with us to forge a mutually acceptable resolution of our \nserious constitutional concerns.\u201d 135 Cong. Rec. 5033\u201334 (1989).  Congress then passed the \n \n8   The President\u2019s other \u201cmajor objection\u201d to the Whistleblower Act\u201d was that it \u201cessentially \nrig[ged] the [MSPB]\u2019s process against agency personnel managers in favor of employees\u201d by \n\u201csubstantially reduc[ing] the factual showing required of the employee and . . . substantially \nincreas[ing] the burden on agencies.\u201d  President Reagan Mem. at 1378.    \n16 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 17 of 67\nrevised Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211 et seq., and President George H.W. \nBush signed it into law on April 10, 1989.  Statement by President George Bush Upon Signing \nS.20, 25 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 516 (Apr. 10, 1989) (\u201cPresident Bush Statement\u201d).  President \nBush noted the \u201csubstantial improvement\u201d in the bill\u2019s \u201cdeletion of provisions that would have \nenabled the Special Counsel, an executive branch official, to oppose other executive branch \nagencies in court.\u201d  Id.  And he further stated, \u201cI am pleased that the Administration was able to \nwork in a spirit of cooperation and bipartisanship with both Houses of Congress to resolve our \ndifferences and enact this important legislation.\u201d Id.  \n  Congress has reappropriated funds to the Office of Special Counsel every year since the \npassage of the Whistleblower Protection Act, see, e.g., Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, \nPub. L. 118-47, 138 Stat 460 (Mar. 23, 2024), and it has adjusted the Special Counsel\u2019s authority \nseveral times.   \nIn 1994, at the previous \u201crequest of the Bush Administration,\u201d S. Rep. No. 1035-358, at 4 \n(1994), Congress passed an act reauthorizing both the Special Counsel and the Merits System \nProtection Board.  United States Office of Special Counsel, Merits System Protection Board: \nAuthorization (\u201c1994 Reauthorization Act\u201d), Pub. L. No. 103-424, 108 Stat. 4361 (1994).  In \naddition to reauthorizing the Special Counsel for three years, the Act clarified \u201cthe rules governing \nOSC disclosure of information about whistleblowers,\u201d \u201crequir[ed] OSC to provide appropriate \ninformation to whistleblowers whose cases have been closed,\u201d \u201c[e]stablish[ed] a fixed time limit \nfor OSC to take action on whistleblower cases,\u201d and \u201censur[ed] that whistleblowers ha[d] access \nto relevant evidence in the event that they bring their own cases to the [MSPB].\u201d  S. Rep. No. 103-\n358, at 2.  President Bill Clinton ended up signing the 1994 Reauthorization Act into law, with \n17 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 18 of 67\nonly one noted concern regarding a provision of the law unrelated to the Special Counsel.9  \nStatement by President William J. Clinton Upon Signing, 30 Weekly Comp. Pres. Doc. 2202 (Oct. \n25, 1994) (\u201cPresident Clinton Statement\u201d).       \n  Almost two decades later, Congress passed the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement \nAct of 2012 (\u201cWPEA\u201d), Pub. L. 112-199, 126 Stat. 1465 (2012), to \u201cstrengthen the rights of and \nprotections for federal whistleblowers so that they can more effectively help root out waste, fraud, \nand abuse in the federal government.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 112-155, at 1 (2012).  The act \u201cprovide[d] for \ncertain authority for the Special Counsel,\u201d id., specifically, its amicus curiae authority that \nCongress found \u201cnecessary to ensure the OSC\u2019s effectiveness.\u201d  Id. at 12\u201314.   \nAs the Senate Report on the bill explained, when a federal employee brings allegations of \na prohibited personnel practice to the Special Counsel, he \u201cinvestigates . . . to determine whether \nthere are reasonable grounds to believe that a prohibited personnel practice has occurred.\u201d  Id. at \n13.  If he makes a positive determination, he notifies the agency involved so that it can take \ncorrective action, and if it refuses, he \u201cis authorized to file a petition for corrective action with the \nMSPB.\u201d  Id.  But after the MSPB renders a decision, the Special Counsel\u2019s ability to \u201cenforce and \ndefend whistleblower laws in the context of that claim is limited,\u201d because he \u201cdoes not have \nauthority to ask the MSPB to reconsider its decision,\u201d 10 and he cannot \u201cseek review of an MSPB \ndecision by the Federal Circuit.\u201d  Id.  Further, \u201c[b]ecause the OSC lacks independent litigating \n \n9   According to President Clinton\u2019s statement upon signing the Reauthorization Act, he had \n\u201cbeen advised that one provision in this bill (section 9), which concerns the apparent authority of \nan arbitrator to discipline a Federal employee who was not a party to the original action, raises \nserious constitutional questions.\u201d  President Clinton Statement at 2022. \n \n10   As the report explained, \u201cIn contrast, the Office of Personnel Management . . . , which \ntypically is not a party to the case, can request that the MSPB reconsider its rulings.\u201d  S. Rep. No. \n112-155, at 13. \n18 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 19 of 67\nauthority,\u201d the Department of Justice represented the OSC in cases appealed to the Federal Circuit \nby the employee.  Id.  Therefore, Congress authorized the Special Counsel to \u201cappear as amicus \ncuriae in any\u201d prohibited personnel practice case brought to the federal court by the aggrieved \nemployee.  WPEA, Pub. L. No. 112-199, \u00a7 113, 126 Stat. 1465, 1472 (2012).  President Barack \nObama signed the Whistleblower Protection Enhancement Act into law on November 27, 2012.  \nStatement by Press Secretary on H.R. 2606, H.R. 4114, S. 743 and S. 1956, White House Off. of \nCommc\u2019ns (Nov. 27, 2012). \n  Finally, in 2018, Congress reauthorized the Special Counsel in the omnibus National \nDefense Authorization Act, Pub. L. No. 115-91, 131 Stat. 1283 (2018).  That legislation clarified \nthe type of information that federal agencies subject to an OSC investigation could or could not \nwithhold from the agency.  Id.  And it established another reporting obligation on the OSC by \nrequiring it to submit an annual report to Congress regarding the agency\u2019s activities.  Id.  President \nDonald Trump signed the National Defense Authorization Act into law, noting \u201cthe longstanding \nposition of the executive branch that . . . insulation of a principal officer like the Special Counsel \nraises serious constitutional concerns.\u201d  Statement by President Donald J. Trump on H.R. 2810, \nWhite House Off. of Commc\u2019ns (Dec. 12, 2017). \nB.  Statutory Background \nAs it is currently constituted, the Office of the Special Counsel is led by the Special \nCounsel, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(a), who is \u201cappointed by the President, by and with the advice and \nconsent of the Senate\u201d to serve \u201cfor a term of 5 years.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1211(b).  Congress requires that the \nSpecial Counsel must \u201cbe an attorney who, by demonstrated ability, background, training, or \nexperience, is especially qualified to carry out the functions of the position.\u201d  Id.  And, by statute, \n19 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 20 of 67\n\u201c[t]he Special Counsel may be removed by the President only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or \nmalfeasance in office.\u201d  Id.    \nThe Special Counsel and the OSC are authorized to operate in four primary ways.  First, \nthe agency acts as a confidential channel for federal employees to disclose \u201cinformation\u201d that the \nindividual \u201creasonably believes evidences\u201d:  (1) \u201ca violation of any law, rule, or regulation\u201d;  \n(2) \u201cgross mismanagement\u201d;  (3) \u201ca gross waste of funds\u201d;  (4) \u201can abuse of authority\u201d; or (5) a \n\u201csubstantial and specific danger to public health or safety.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1213(a)(1)(A)\u2013(B).  Without the \nindividual\u2019s consent, the \u201cidentity of any individual who makes a disclosure . . . may not be \ndisclosed by the Special Counsel\u201d unless he determines that disclosure is necessary to avoid \n\u201cimminent danger to public health and safety or imminent violation of any criminal law.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 1213(h).   \nUpon receipt of a disclosure, the Special Counsel has forty-five days to determine whether \nthere  is  a  \u201csubstantial  likelihood\u201d  that  the  information  reveals  a  violation  of  law,  gross \nmismanagement or waste of funds, abuse of authority, or danger to public health or safety.  Id. \n\u00a7 1213(b).  If the Special Counsel makes a positive determination, he must transmit the disclosed \ninformation to the appropriate agency head, and direct the agency head to investigate and submit \na written report of their findings to the Special Counsel.  Id. \u00a7 1213(c)(1).  The Special Counsel \nthen reviews the report, gives the whistleblower an opportunity to comment, and adds any of his \nown \u201ccomments or recommendations.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1213(e)(1), (3).  The Special Counsel is then required \nto  submits  the  agency\u2019s  report,  the  whistleblower\u2019s  comments,  and  his  comments  or \nrecommendations \u201cto the President and the congressional committees with jurisdiction over the \nagency.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1213(e)(3).  And any case involving \u201cevidence of a criminal violation\u201d is referred \nto the Attorney General.  Id. \u00a7 1213(f).   \n20 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 21 of 67\nSecond, the agency is authorized to \u201creceive and investigate allegations of prohibited \npersonnel practices.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1212(a)(2).  Among other things, prohibited personnel practices include \ndiscrimination, coerced political activity, willful obstruction of an individual\u2019s right to compete \nfor employment, and reprisal for whistleblowing. Id. \u00a7 2302(b)(1)\u2013(14) (defining \u201cprohibited \npersonnel practice\u201d).   \nWithin 240 days of receiving an allegation of a prohibited practice, the Special Counsel \nmust determine whether \u201cthere are reasonable grounds to believe\u201d that the practice has occurred, \nexists, or will occur.  See id. \u00a7 1214(b)(2)(A)(i).  He can also, \u201cin the absence of an allegation, \nconduct  an  investigation\u201d  to  determine  whether  there  are  reasonable  grounds  to  believe  a \nprohibited practice, \u201cor a pattern of prohibited\u201d practices, has occurred, exists, or will be taken.  \nId. \u00a7 1214(a)(5).  In furtherance of his investigatory duty, the OSC may \u201cissue subpoenas\u201d and \norder \u201cthe taking of depositions\u201d and \u201cresponses to written interrogatories.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1212(b)(2).  If \na party fails to obey a subpoena issued, \u201cthe Special Counsel may apply to the Merit Systems \nProtection Board to enforce [it] in court.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1212(b)(3)(A).  The Special Counsel is authorized \nto  \u201chave  timely  access  to  all  records,  data,  reports,  audits,  reviews,  documents,  papers, \nrecommendations,  or  other  material  available  to  the  applicable  agency  that  relate  to  an \ninvestigation,\u201d id. \u00a7 1212(b)(5)(A)(i), but there are some exceptions.  The Inspector General may \nwithhold material \u201ccontain[ing] information derived from, or pertaining to intelligence activities,\u201d \nid. \u00a7 1212(b)(5)(B)(ii), and the Inspector or Attorney General may withhold material reasonably \n\u201cexpected to interfere with a criminal investigation or prosecution.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1212(b)(5)(B)(iii)(I)(aa).   \nIf the Special Counsel determines that there are reasonable grounds, he reports that \ndetermination to the head of the agency involved, along with the MSPB and the OPM, so that it \ncan remedy the action.  Id. \u00a7 1214(b)(2)(B).   \n21 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 22 of 67\nThe OSC refers certain cases to its Alternative Dispute Resolution Unit, which may \nconduct voluntary mediation between the employing agency and the employee.  See Alternative \nDispute  Resolution  Process,  Off.  of  Special  Counsel,  https://osc.gov/Services/Pages/ADR-\nOurProcess.aspx  (last  visited  Feb.  22,  2024).    A  report  by  the  MSPB  in  2010  stated  that \n\u201c[t]ypically, OSC obtains corrective action through negotiation between the complainant and the \nagency.\u201d   See Merit Sys. Prot. Bd., Whistleblower Protections for Federal Employees:  A Report \nto the President and the Congress of the United States 43 (2010).  But if the agency does not take \ncorrective action, \u201cafter a reasonable period of time,\u201d the Special Counsel \u201cmay petition the Board \nfor corrective action.\u201d  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1214(b)(2)(C).  When he petitions for corrective action, the \nMSPB provides an opportunity for him to submit \u201coral or written comments\u201d on the matter.  Id. \n\u00a7 1214(b)(3)(A).  The Special Counsel may also request that the MSPB \u201corder a stay of any \npersonnel action for 45 days\u201d if he \u201cdetermines that there are reasonable grounds to believe that \nthe personnel action\u201d would be taken \u201cas a result of a prohibited personnel practice.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 1214(b)(1)(A)(i).  And if the Special Counsel believes disciplinary action should be taken, he \nmust prepare a written complaint to the MSPB.  Id. \u00a7 1215(a)(1)(A). \nThe Special Counsel does not have independent authority to appeal or otherwise litigate a \ndecision by the MSPB.  If an employee exercises their right to appeal an MSPB decision to federal \ncourt, \u201c[t]he Special Counsel is authorized to appear as amicus curiae . . . to present the views of \nthe Special Counsel . . . and the impact court decisions would have on the enforcement of such \nprovisions of law.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1212(h)(1).   \nSimilarly, the Special Counsel is also empowered to \u201creview rules and regulations\u201d issued \nby the Office of Personnel Management, and he must \u201cfile a written complaint\u201d with the MSPB if \n22 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 23 of 67\nhe \u201cfinds that any such rule or regulation would, on its face or as implemented, require the \ncommission of a prohibited personnel practice.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1212(a)(4).     \nThird, the Special Counsel has authority to investigate violations of the Hatch Act, 5 U.S.C. \n\u00a7  7321  et  seq.,  and  the  Uniformed  Services  Employment  and  Reemployment  Rights  Act \n(\u201cUSERRA\u201d), 38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4301\u201335 et seq., along with certain withholdings under the Freedom \nof Information Act (\u201cFOIA\u201d), 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 552.  The Hatch Act regulates government employee \nparticipation in partisan political activities, generally prohibiting:  the use of \u201cofficial authority or \ninfluence for the purpose of interfering with or affecting the result of an election\u201d; soliciting, \naccepting, or receiving political contributions from any person; running for election to a partisan \npolitical office; and engaging in partisan political activity on official duty time.  5 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 7323(a), 7324(a).  The Special Counsel is responsible for investigating complaints of prohibited \npolitical activities under the Act, id. \u00a7 1216(a)(1), and if he believes that disciplinary action is \nwarranted, he prepares a written complaint to the MSBP.  Id. \u00a7 1215(a)(1).11   \nThe OSC also has the authority to appear before the MSPB on behalf of a person who has \nbeen unable to resolve a complaint brought under the USERRA, which prohibits employment \ndiscrimination against members of the uniformed services and veterans \u201cbecause of their service \nin the uniformed services.\u201d  38 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 4301(a)(3), 4311, 4324.  This is the only instance in \nwhich the Special Counsel is permitted to appear on behalf of a party (not as a party himself) \nbefore the MSPB or the Federal Circuit, and in doing so, he would be serving as an advocate for \nthe servicemember or veteran, not the OSC.  Id. \u00a7 4324(a), (d).   \n \n11   Hatch Act violations carry only civil penalties, 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 7326, which are decided by the \nMerits System Protection Board.  \n23 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 24 of 67\nThe OSC additionally has authority to investigate and bring disciplinary complaints for \n\u201carbitrary and capricious withholding[s] of information\u201d under FOIA, except for withholdings of \n\u201cforeign intelligence or counterintelligence information . . . specifically prohibited by law or by \nExecutive order.\u201d  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1216(a)(3), (c).     \n  Fourth, OSC is obliged by statute to make a series of reports to Congress.  In addition to \nthe individual reports the agency must make to Congress concerning credible whistleblower \nviolations, id. \u00a7 1213(e)(3)\u2013(4), the OSC must submit an \u201cannual\u201d report to Congress on its \n\u201cactivities.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1218.  The report must include, among other things, \u201cthe number, types, and \ndisposition of allegations of prohibited personnel practices filed with the Special Counsel and the \ncosts of resolving such allegations,\u201d \u201cthe number of investigations conducted,\u201d and \u201cthe number \nof stays and disciplinary actions negotiated with agencies.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1218(1)\u2013(13).  The agency must \nalso submit a report to Congress each time the OSC resolves an allegation \u201cby an agreement \nbetween an agency and an individual.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1217(b)(1).  Further, \u201con the request of any committee \nor subcommittee,\u201d the Special Counsel or his designee \u201cshall transmit to the Congress . . . by \nreport,  testimony,  or  otherwise,  information  and  the  Special  Counsel\u2019s  views  on  functions, \nresponsibilities, or other matters relating to the Office.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1217(a).  That information is also \n\u201ctransmitted concurrently to the President and any other appropriate agency in the executive \nbranch.\u201d  Id.   \nC.

The administrative \nstay ordered that plaintiff continue to serve as Special Counsel until midnight on February 13, \n \n12   President  Biden\u2019s  statement  can  be  found  at  President  Biden  Announces  Hampton \nDellinger as Nominee for Special Counsel, Office of the Special Counsel, THE WHITE HOUSE \n(October  3,  2023), https://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-\nreleases/2023/10/03/president-biden-announces-hampton-dellinger-as-nominee-for-special-\ncounsel-office-of-the-special-counsel/. \n \n13   During the hearing, counsel for plaintiff also moved orally for the entry of a preliminary \ninjunction and stated that \u201cwe would be content to allow the Court to treat our TRO memorandum \nof law as our opening brief in support of a preliminary injunction.\u201d  TRO Tr. at 20.   \n25 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 26 of 67\n2025.  Id.  Defendants appealed the Court\u2019s administrative stay to the United States Court of \nAppeals for the District of Columbia.  See Defs.\u2019 Notice of Appeal [Dkt. # 7].   \nThe next day, February 11, defendants responded to plaintiff\u2019s motion for temporary \nrestraining order, see Defs.\u2019 Opp. to Mot. for TRO [Dkt. # 11], and they moved to stay the Court\u2019s \nadministrative stay.  See Defs.\u2019 Mot. to Stay the Ct.\u2019s Administrative Stay [Dkt. # 10] (\u201cDefs.\u2019 \nMot. to Stay\u201d).  Plaintiff responded to defendants\u2019 motion to stay on the same day.  See Pl.\u2019s Mem. \nin Opp. to Defs.\u2019 Mot. to Stay [Dkt. # 12]. \nIn the early afternoon of February 12, 2025, defendants notified the Court \u201cthat in the \nafternoon on Tuesday, February 11, 2025, the President designated the Secretary of Veteran \nAffairs, Doug Collins, to serve as Acting Special Counsel,\u201d but that the Court\u2019s administrative stay \nmade it \u201cimpossible for the office to be filled by the presidential designee.\u201d  Defs.\u2019 Notice of the \nPresident\u2019s Designation of Acting Special Counsel [Dkt. # 13] (\u201cNotice of Designation\u201d) at 1 \n(quotations omitted).  The same day, the D.C. Circuit dismissed defendants\u2019 appeal of the Court\u2019s \nadministrative stay for lack of jurisdiction.  See Order, Dellinger v. Bessent, No. 25-5025 (D.C. \n \nCir. Feb. 12, 2025).   \nLater that night, a day before the three-day administrative stay was set to expire, the Court \ngranted plaintiff\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order.  See Order [Dkt. # 14] (\u201cTRO Order\u201d).  \nIt ordered that \u201cuntil the Court rules on the entry of a preliminary injunction, plaintiff Hampton \nDellinger shall continue to serve as the Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel.\u201d  Id. at \n26.  The Court ordered that defendants must \u201cnot deny him access to the resources or materials of \nthat office or recognize the authority of any other person as Special Counsel.\u201d  Id.  The order also \nvacated the administrative stay entered on February 10, 2025, and denied defendants\u2019 motion to \nstay the Court\u2019s administrative stay as moot.  Id.  The Court scheduled a hearing on plaintiff\u2019s \n26 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 27 of 67\nmotion for a preliminary injunction on February 26, giving defendants time to oppose the motion \nand plaintiff time to reply.  Id. at 27.  The Court also directed the parties to inform the Court of \ntheir positions on whether consideration of the preliminary injunction should be consolidated with \nconsideration of the merits under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2).  Id. \n   Defendants again appealed the Court\u2019s order to the D.C. Circuit, see Defs.\u2019 Notice of \nAppeal [Dkt. # 15], and they moved to stay the order pending their appeal.  See Defs.\u2019 Mot. to Stay \nthe Ct.\u2019s TRO [Dkt. # 16].  On February 13, the Court denied defendants\u2019 motion to stay.  See \nOrder [Dkt. # 19].  It explained that the temporary restraining order preserved the status quo of the \nparties, id. at 1\u20132, which is defined as the \u201clast uncontested status which preceded the pending \ncontroversy.\u201d Dist. 50, United Mine Workers of Am. v. Int\u2019l Union, United Mine Workers of Am., \n412 F.2d 165, 168 (D.C. Cir. 1969).  The Court of Appeals dismissed defendants\u2019 second appeal \nfor lack of jurisdiction on February 15.  See Order, Dellinger v. Bessent, 25-5028 (D.C. Cir. Feb. \n15, 2025).     \n  On February 14, the parties filed a joint status report with their positions on consolidation \nwith the merits.  See Joint Status Report [Dkt. # 20].  Plaintiff \u201cdefer[red] to the Court\u2019s judgment\u201d \non consolidation, id. at 1, and defendants \u201crequest[ed] that the Court consolidate consideration of \nthe request for preliminary injunction with consideration of the merits.\u201d  Id. at 2.  The parties also \njointly proposed a schedule for additional briefing.  Id. at 1\u20132.  On February 15, the Court deemed \nplaintiff\u2019s motion for a temporary restraining order to be a motion for preliminary injunction, and \nit consolidated consideration of that motion with consideration of the merits under Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 65(a)(2).

See Reply in Supp. of Mot. for TRO \n[Dkt. # 21]; see TRO Order.   \n  On February 21, defendants moved for summary judgment, and as noted above, plaintiff \nopposed the motion and filed a cross-motion of his own.  At the hearing on February 26, plaintiff \nclarified that he was seeking judgment in his favor on Count One of his complaint, which alleged \nultra vires action in violation of 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b).  Tr. of Proceedings [Dkt. # 28] (\u201cTr.\u201d) at \n19\u201321.  The Court heard extensive arguments on the merits and any available remedies, including \n \nthe permanent injunction factors.  See Tr.  Shortly after the hearing, the Court issued an order \nextending the temporary restraining order for an additional three days under Rule 65(b)(2).  See \nOrder [Dkt. # 27] at 4\u20135.  The order expires today and will be rendered moot with the ruling on \nthe merits. \nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \nA.  Motion for Preliminary Injunction  \n\u201c[A] preliminary injunction is an extraordinary and drastic remedy, one that should not be \ngranted unless the movant, by a clear showing, carries the burden of persuasion.\u201d Mazurek v. \nArmstrong,  520  U.S.  968,  972  (1997)  (emphasis  in  original);  see  also  Munaf  v.  Geren, \n553 U.S. 674, 89\u201390 (2008). \n  As the Supreme Court explained in Winter v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc., \n555 U.S. 7, 20 (2008), when considering a motion for a preliminary injunction, the Court must \nconsider whether the movant has met its burden of demonstrating that:  (1) it \u201cis likely to succeed \non the merits\u201d;  (2) it is \u201clikely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief\u201d;  \n(3) \u201cthe balance of equities tips in [its] favor\u201d; and (4) an injunction serves the public interest.  Id.  \n28 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 29 of 67\nFor some time, the Court of Appeals adhered to a \u201csliding-scale\u201d approach, where \u201ca strong \nshowing on one factor could make up for a weaker showing on another.\u201d  Sherley v. Sebelius, \n644 F.3d 388, 392 (D.C. Cir. 2011).  However, in Sherley, the Court explained that because the \nSupreme  Court\u2019s  decision  in  Winter \u201cseemed  to  treat  the  four  factors  as  independent \nrequirements,\u201d it had more recently \u201cread Winter at least to suggest if not to hold \u2018that a likelihood \nof success is an independent, free-standing requirement for a preliminary injunction.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 393, \nquoting Davis v. Pension Benefit Guar. Corp., 571 F.3d 1288, 1296 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (Kavanaugh, \nJ., concurring).   \nThe Court of Appeals has not gone further to clarify whether the sliding scale approach is \ninconsistent with Winter, and the manner in which courts should weigh the four factors \u201cremains \nan open question\u201d in this Circuit.  Aamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d 1023, 1043 (D.C. Cir. 2014). See \nalso League of Women Voters v. Newby, 838 F.3d 1, 7 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (\u201cBecause appellants \nsatisfy each of the four preliminary injunction factors, this case presents no occasion for the court \nto decide whether the \u2018sliding scale\u2019 approach remains valid after Winter.\u201d); Changji Esquel \nTextile Co. v. Raimondo, 40 F.4th 716, 726 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (reiterating that the Court has not yet \ndecided the issue).  \nWhatever the status of the sliding scale might be, the D.C. Circuit has ruled that a failure \nto  show  a  likelihood  of  success  on  the  merits  is  sufficient  to  defeat  a  motion  for \na preliminary injunction.  See Ark. Dairy Coop. Ass\u2019n v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Agric., 573 F.3d 815, 832 \n(D.C. Cir. 2009); Apotex, Inc. v. FDA, 449 F.3d 1249, 1253\u201354 (D.C. Cir. 2006).  As another court \nin this district has observed, \u201cabsent a substantial indication of likely success on the merits, there \nwould be no justification for the Court\u2019s intrusion into the ordinary processes of administration \nand judicial review.\u201d  Navistar, Inc. v. EPA, Civil Action No. 11-cv-449 (RLW), 2011 WL \n29 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 30 of 67\n3743732, at *3 (D.D.C. Aug. 25, 2011) (alteration omitted), quoting Hubbard v. United States, \n496 F. Supp. 2d 194, 198 (D.D.C. 2007). \nAnd regardless of whether the sliding scale framework applies, it remains the law in this \nCircuit that a movant must demonstrate irreparable harm, which has \u201calways\u201d been a \u201cbasis of \ninjunctive  relief  in  the  federal  courts.\u201d   Sampson  v.  Murray,  415  U.S.  61,  88  (1974), \nquoting Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500, 506\u201307 (1959).  A failure to show \nirreparable harm is grounds for the Court to refuse to issue an injunction, \u201ceven if the other three \nfactors entering the calculus merit such relief.\u201d  Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, \n454 F.3d 290, 297 (D.C. Cir. 2006).   \nSince the motion for preliminary relief has been consolidated with consideration of the \nmerits, and since this opinion will address the merits, there is no need to assess plaintiff\u2019s \nlikelihood of success.  And the request for permanent injunctive relief, along with the ruling on \nthe merits, has obviated the balancing factors supporting interim relief.   \nB.  Motion for Summary Judgment \nSummary judgment is appropriate \u201cif the movant shows that there is no genuine dispute as \nto any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n56(a).  The party seeking summary judgment \u201cbears the initial responsibility of informing the \ndistrict  court  of  the  basis  for  its  motion,  and  identifying  those  portions  of  the  pleadings, \ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, \nwhich it believes demonstrate the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.\u201d  Celotex Corp. v. \nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 323 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted).  To defeat summary \njudgment, the non-moving party must \u201cdesignate specific facts showing that there is a genuine \nissue for trial.\u201d  Id. at 324 (internal quotation marks omitted).   \n30 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 31 of 67\nThe mere existence of a factual dispute is insufficient to preclude summary judgment.  \nAnderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247\u201348 (1986).  A dispute is \u201cgenuine\u201d only if a \nreasonable fact-finder could find for the non-moving party; a fact is \u201cmaterial\u201d only if it is capable \nof affecting the outcome of the litigation.  Id. at 248; Laningham v. U.S. Navy, 813 F.2d 1236, \n1241 (D.C. Cir. 1987).  In assessing a party\u2019s motion, the court must \u201cview the facts and draw \nreasonable inferences \u2018in the light most favorable to the party opposing the summary judgment \nmotion.\u2019\u201d  Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 378 (2007) (alterations omitted), quoting United States \nv. Diebold, Inc., 369 U.S. 654, 655 (1962) (per curiam). \n\u201cThe rule governing cross-motions for summary judgment . . . is that neither party waives \nthe right to a full trial on the merits by filing its own motion; each side concedes that no material \nfacts are at issue only for the purposes of its own motion.\u201d  Sherwood v. Wash. Post, 871 F.2d 1144, \n1147 n.4 (D.C. Cir. 1989) (alteration in original), quoting McKenzie v. Sawyer, 684 F.2d 62, 68 \nn.3 (D.C. Cir. 1982).  In assessing each party\u2019s motion, \u201c[a]ll underlying facts and inferences are \nanalyzed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\u201d  N.S. ex rel. Stein v. District of \nColumbia, 709 F. Supp. 2d 57, 65 (D.D.C. 2010), citing Anderson, 477 U.S. at 247. \nC.  Motion for Permanent Injunction \nGiven the procedural posture of the case, the Court must apply the standard for the issuance \nof a permanent injunction. \nA plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction must demonstrate that:  (1) he has suffered an \nirreparable injury;  (2) that remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate \nto compensate for that injury;  (3) considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and \ndefendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) the public interest would not be disserved by \n31 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 32 of 67\na permanent injunction.  Monsanto Co. v. Geerston Seed Farms, 561 U.S. 139, 156\u201357 (2010), \nquoting eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, LLC, 547 U.S. 388, 391 (2006).   \nANALYSIS \nI.  The Court will grant summary judgment in favor of plaintiff on Count One. \n \nA.  The purported termination of the Special Counsel without cause violates \n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b). \n \nCount One of the complaint alleges that plaintiff\u2019s removal was ultra vires in violation of \n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b).  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 37\u201341.  \nAs a \u201cweapon in the arsenal for attacking federal administrative action,\u201d an ultra vires claim \nrequires the Court to determine whether defendants \u201cplainly act[ed] in excess of [their] delegated \npowers and contrary to a specific prohibition in the statute that is clear and mandatory.\u201d  Fed. \nExpress Corp. v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Commerce, 39 F.4th 756, 763 (D.C. Cir. 2022).  The statutory \nmandate at issue is section 1211(b), which reads: \nThe Special Counsel shall be appointed by the President, by and with the \nadvice and consent of the Senate, for a term of 5 years . . . .  The Special \nCounsel shall be an attorney who, by demonstrated ability, background, \ntraining, or experience, is especially qualified to carry out the functions of \nthe position . . . .  The Special Counsel may be removed by the President \nonly for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.  \n \n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b).  \n  There is no genuine dispute of fact that would preclude a finding that plaintiff\u2019s removal \nwas contrary to section 1211(b).  See Defs.\u2019 Statement of Undisputed Material Facts [Dkt. # 22-2] \n(\u201cDefs.\u2019 SOF\u201d); Pl.\u2019s Statement of Material Facts Not in Genuine Dispute [Dkt. # 23-1] (\u201cPl.\u2019s \nSOF\u201d).  The parties agree that, in accordance with the statute, plaintiff was nominated by the \nPresident and confirmed by the Senate to be Special Counsel.  Defs.\u2019 SOF \u00b6 1; Pl.\u2019s SOF \u00b6\u00b6 1\u20132.  \nThe parties also agree that on February 7, plaintiff received an email from Sergio Gor, Assistant \n32 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 33 of 67\nto the President, Director of the White House Presidential Personnel Office, saying nothing more \nthan his \u201cposition as Special Counsel of the US Office of Special Counsel is terminated, effectively \nimmediately.\u201d  Defs.\u2019 SOF \u00b6 2; Pl.\u2019s SOF \u00b6 5; Ex. A.  The email did not identify a reason, and it \ndid not assert that plaintiff was being removed for \u201cinefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance \nin office.\u201d  Nor have defendants asserted since then that he was terminated for one of those reasons \nor any other.  Having been sworn into office on March 6, 2024, section 1211(b) required plaintiff \nto serve his five-year term until March 2029 unless the President removed him \u201cfor inefficiency, \nneglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\u201d  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b).  So, the undisputed facts show that \nthe purported termination contravened section 1211(b), and therefore the Court finds that it was \nan ultra vires action.     \nB.  The  statutory  term  of  five  years,  protected  by  the  removal  for  cause \nprovision, is not unconstitutional. \n1.  Neither Seila Law or Collins compel the conclusion that section 1211(b) \nis unconstitutional. \nDefendants\u2019  only  response  to  this  reading  of  the  plain  text  is  that  the  statute  is \nunconstitutional.  Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 6\u201315.  But no court has reached that conclusion. Instead, the \nSupreme Court made it a point to carve the OSC out of its pronouncements concerning the \nPresident\u2019s Article II prerogative to have unrestricted control over who should assist him in \ndischarging his responsibilities.  \n  In their motion for summary judgment, defendants paint with a broad brush: \n \nIn the last five years, the Supreme Court has twice held that restrictions on \nthe President\u2019s authority to remove principal officers who serve as the sole \nheads of executive agencies violate Article II\u2014in those cases, the single \nheads  of  the  Consumer  Financial  Protection  Bureau  and  the  Federal \nHousing Finance Agency. . . .  Whatever the agency, for the President to \ndischarge his constitutional duty to supervise those who exercise executive \npower on his behalf, the President can \u201cremove the head of an agency with \na single top officer\u201d at will.  \n33 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 34 of 67\n \nDefs.\u2019 Mot. at 1, citing Seila Law LLC v. CFPB, 591 U.S. 197 (2020) and Collins v. Yellen, 594 U.S. \n220, 256 (2021). 14  But that is an oversimplified and inaccurate summary of the authority that \nguides the determination to be made, and the Supreme Court, in deciding the particular cases \nbefore it, did not announced a blanket rule that governs \u201cwhatever the agency.\u201d  To the contrary, \nin both Seila Law and Collins, the Court went into great detail about the individual agencies at \nissue, and the reasoning underlying those decisions does not apply to the case at hand.15 \n \n14   The Court addressed both Seila Law and Collins in its February 12 Temporary Restraining \nOrder.  TRO Order at 9\u201315.   \n \n15    Defendants also cite Trump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593 (2024), for the proposition that \n\u201cthe President\u2019s power to remove executive officers of the United States whom he has appointed \nmay not be regulated by Congress or reviewed by the courts.\u201d Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 7 (internal quotations \nomitted).  But this lifts a single phrase far out of the context of a case that has nothing to do with \nthe questions raised here.  In Trump, the Court considered whether allegations in the indictment \nagainst Donald Trump concerning threats he allegedly made to replace the Acting Attorney \nGeneral, during discussions with Justice Department officials after the 2020 election, implicated \nthe use of his official authority such that he would be absolutely immune from prosecution for the \nalleged conduct.  Id. at 602\u201303, 617.  As part of that particular analysis, the Court observed:  \n \nInvestigative and prosecutorial decisionmaking is \u201cthe special province of \nthe Executive Branch,\u201d Heckler v. Chaney, 470 U.S. 821, 832 (1985), and \nthe Constitution vests the entirety of the executive power in the President, \nArt. II, \u00a7 1.  For that reason, Trump\u2019s threatened removal of the Acting \nAttorney  General  likewise  implicates  \u201cconclusive  and  preclusive\u201d \nPresidential authority.  As we have explained, the President\u2019s power to \nremove \u201cexecutive officers of the United States whom he has appointed\u201d \nmay  not  be  regulated  by  Congress  or  reviewed  by  the  courts.    The \nPresident\u2019s \u201cmanagement of the Executive Branch\u201d requires him to have \n\u201cunrestricted power to remove the most important of his subordinates\u201d\u2014\nsuch as the Attorney General\u2014\u201cin their most important duties.\u201d \n \nId. at 620\u201321, citing Myers, 272 U.S. at 106, 176, and Nixon v. Fitzgerald, 457 U.S. 731, 750 \n(internal citations omitted).  While the Heckler proposition is well-established, this discussion is \ninapposite here because it turned upon the enforcement of criminal laws, the \u201cquintessentially \nexecutive function\u201d over which the executive branch has \u201cexclusive and absolute discretion.\u201d  That \nis not the situation here.  The Special Counsel\u2019s role is not analogous to (continued on next page)  \n34 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 35 of 67\n  In Seila Law, the question arose when a law firm resisting a civil investigative demand \nissued by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (\u201cCFPB\u201d) challenged the legitimacy of the \nagency\u2019s structure.  591 U.S. at 208.  To address that contention, the Court began by reviewing its \nopinions on the President\u2019s power to remove executive branch officials.  It pointed to its decision \nin Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926), which held that Article II accords the President the \n\u201cgeneral administrative control of those executing the laws, including the power of appointment \nand removal of executive officers.\u201d  Id. at 163\u201364.  The Seila Law opinion also included the \nreminder that in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, 561 U.S. \n477 (2010), the Court reaffirmed that \u201cas a general matter, the Constitution gives the President the \nauthority to remove those who assist him in carrying out his duties.\u201d Seila Law 591 U.S. at 204, \nciting Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 513\u201314.  \nSeila Law also discussed the Court\u2019s later opinion in Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. United States, \n295 U.S. 602 (1935), which let restrictions on removal of the members of the New Deal-era FTC, \nas it was constituted in 1935, stand.16  It emphasized that \u201c[w]hile recognizing an exception for \nmulti-member bodies with \u2018quasi-judicial\u2019 or \u2018quasi-legislative\u2019 functions, Humphrey\u2019s Executor \nreaffirmed the core holding of Myers that the President has \u2018unrestrictable power . . . to remove \npurely executive officers.\u2019\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 217.  But it noted that the Humphrey\u2019s Executor \ncourt also \u201cacknowledged that between purely executive officers on the one hand, and officers that \n \nthat of the leaders of the United States Department of Justice, who are among \u201cthe most important\u201d \nof the President\u2019s \u201csubordinates.\u201d \n \n16   The  Court  notes  that  this  ruling  does  not  depend  upon  the  continuing  vitality  of \nHumphrey\u2019s Executor.  It is included here since it was part of the discussion in Seila Law, but it \ndealt with multi-member entities and not an organization with a single head like the OSC.  \nHumphrey\u2019s Executor, 295 U.S. at 619. \n35 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 36 of 67\nclosely resembled the FTC Commissioners on the other, there existed \u2018a field of doubt\u2019 that the \nCourt left for \u2018future consideration.\u2019\u201d  Id., citing Humphrey\u2019s Executor, 295 U.S. at 632.  And \n\u201c[b]ecause the Court limited its holding to \u2018officers of the kind here under consideration,\u2019 . . . the \ncontours of the Humphrey\u2019s Executor exception depend upon the characteristics of the agency \nbefore the Court.\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 215, quoting Humphrey\u2019s Executor, 295 U.S. at 632. \nSeila Law also summarized the decision in Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988), \nconcerning an \u201cindependent counsel,\u201d who was appointed under the now-expired Independent \nCounsel Reauthorization Act of 1994,17 to investigate whether a particular high-ranking official \nhad committed a crime.  Morrison, 487 U.S. at 660.  The quasi-legislative, quasi-judicial paradigm \nwas not applicable, so the Court \u201cviewed the ultimate question as whether a removal restriction is \nof \u2018such a nature that it impedes the President\u2019s ability to perform his constitutional duty.\u2019\u201d  Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 217, quoting Morrison, 487 U.S. at 691. And while the independent counsel was \nspecifically charged with performing law enforcement functions typically reserved to the executive \nbranch \u2013 in particular, investigating and prosecuting crimes \u2013 the Court \u201cconcluded that the \nremoval protections did not unduly interfere with the functioning of the Executive branch because \n\u2018the independent counsel was an inferior officer under the Appointments Clause, with limited \njurisdiction and tenure and lacking policymaking or significant administrative authority.\u2019\u201d Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 217\u201318 (alterations omitted). \nThe Seila Law opinion characterized the two limited exceptions that had been recognized \nto date \u2013 \u201cone for multimember expert agencies that do not wield substantial executive power, and \none for inferior officers with limited duties and no policymaking or administrative authority\u201d \u2013 as \n \n17   This Act expired on June 30, 1999.  See Final Rule, 64 Fed. Reg. 37,038, 37,041 (July 9, \n1999).   \n36 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 37 of 67\n\u201cwhat up to now have been the outermost constitutional limits of permissible congressional \nrestrictions on the President\u2019s removal powers.\u201d  Id. at 218.  It then explained why neither existing \nexception applied to the CFPB.  \n  With respect to the first exception, Seila Law explained: \n[T]he CFPB Director is hardly a mere legislative or judicial aid.  Instead of \nmaking reports and recommendations to Congress, as the 1935 FTC did, the \nDirector possesses the authority to promulgate binding rules fleshing out 19 \nfederal statutes, including a broad prohibition on unfair and deceptive \npractices  in  a  major  segment  of  the  U.S.  economy.   And  instead  of \nsubmitting recommended dispositions to an Article III court, the Director \nmay unilaterally issue final decisions awarding legal and equitable relief in \nadministrative adjudications.  Finally, the Director's enforcement authority \nincludes the power to seek daunting monetary penalties against private \nparties on behalf of the United States in federal court\u2014a quintessentially \nexecutive power not considered in Humphrey\u2019s Executor.   \n \nId. at 218\u201319.  The Court also highlighted the fact that the CFPB director \u201ccannot be considered \nnon-partisan . . . .\u201d  Id. at 218. \n  As for the comparison to Morrison, there was no question that the CFPB Director was not \nan inferior officer, and she could not be likened to an independent counsel, who, while empowered \nto carry out a core executive function, lacked policy making or administrative authority.  \n[T]he  Director  has  the  sole  responsibility  to  administer  19  separate \nconsumer-protection statutes that cover everything from credit cards and car \npayments to mortgages and student loans.  It is true that the independent \ncounsel in Morrison was empowered to initiate criminal investigations and \nprosecutions, and in that respect wielded core executive power.  But that \npower, while significant, was trained inward to high-ranking Governmental \nactors identified by others, and was confined to a specified matter in which \nthe Department of Justice had a potential conflict of interest.  By contrast, \nthe CFPB Director has the authority to bring the coercive power of the state \nto bear on millions of private citizens and businesses, imposing even billion-\ndollar penalties through administrative adjudications and civil actions \n \n37 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 38 of 67\nId. at 219\u201320.18 \n \n  Since the constitutionality of the provision protecting the CFPB Director could not be \ndecided by invoking either Morrison or Humphrey\u2019s Executor, the Supreme Court framed the \nquestion before it in Seila Law as whether to extend those precedents to the new sort of executive \nagency before it: \u201can independent agency led by a single Director and vested with significant \nexecutive power.\u201d  Id. at 220.  Since to the Court, a lack of historical precedent for such an agency \ncould be potential sign of constitutional problems, it then considered what precedent there was, \nand it pointed out that there were only four isolated examples, and they \u201cshed little light\u201d on what \nto do about the Director of the CFPB.  Id.  \n  One of the four was the Office of Special Counsel.  Id. at 221.  And while the Court recited \nsome of the historical background detailed above \u2013 that the first attempt to create such a position \ndrew an objection from the Office of Legal Counsel under President Carter, and another prior \nversion of the statute was vetoed on constitutional grounds by President Reagan \u2013 it went on to \ndistinguish the OSC from the CFPB: \n[T]he  OSC  exercises  only  limited  jurisdiction to  enforce  certain  rules \ngoverning Federal Government employers and employees.  See 5 U.S.C. \n\u00a71212.  It does not bind private parties at all or wield regulatory authority \ncomparable to the CFPB. \n \n18   Plaintiff argues that Seila Law does not control his case because he falls within the \nexception for inferior officers.  Pl\u2019s Mot. at 11\u201314; see Pl.\u2019s Reply at 1\u20133.  The Court need not find \nthat Dellinger is an inferior officer in order to distinguish Seila Law, and it is not persuaded that \nthe characterization is accurate.  While the Supreme Court has not established a bright-line rule or \nclearly defined test to distinguish between principal and inferior officers, see Edmond v. United \nStates, 520 U.S. 651, 661 (1997); Morrison, 487 U.S. at 671, it has  identified a set of factors to \ninform the determination:  (1) the existence (and identity) of a superior with removal power;  (2) \nthe scope of the officer\u2019s duties;  (3) the scope of the officer\u2019s authority and jurisdiction; and (4) \nand the nature of the officer\u2019s tenure.  See Edmond, 520 U.S. at 661\u201363.  And in light of the first \nfactor, the fact that the President has the authority to remove the Special Counsel for cause appears \nto answer the question.  Moreover, he is a Presidential appointee who must be confirmed by the \nSenate under the Appointments Clause.  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b).   \n38 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 39 of 67\n \nId. at 221; see also id. at 222 (The OSC and two other single-headed agencies \u201cdo not involve \nregulatory or enforcement authority remotely comparable to that exercised by the CFBP.\u201d). \nThe only conclusion one can draw from this discussion is that this case is distinguishable \nfrom Seila Law.  It would be entirely inconsistent and illogical to read the Supreme Court\u2019s \ndescription of the OSC as \u201cnot remotely comparable\u201d to the CFPB, and so distinct that a \nconsideration of its statutory scheme does nothing to illuminate the constitutionality of the CFPB \nstatute, and then maintain that the Seila Law decision invalidating the removal protections in that \nstatute governs the OSC as well.   \nA close review of the statutory scheme at issue confirms that the OSC does not belong in \nthe category of \u201can independent agency led by a single Director and vested with significant \nexecutive power.\u201d  Id. at 220.  Therefore, adherence to the principles and reasoning in Seila Law \nrequires a different outcome in this case.  \nPlaintiff and defendants direct the Court to the same section of the statute, but while it \ncontains some executive-sounding verbs, there is a striking absence of teeth and authority behind \nthem.  The statute provides: \nThe Office of Special Counsel shall . . . receive and investigate allegations \nof prohibited personnel practices, and, where appropriate . . . bring petitions \nfor stays, and petitions for corrective action, . . . and file a complaint or \nmake recommendations for disciplinary action.   \n \n5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1212(a)(2)(A), (B); see id. \u00a7 1214(b)(2)(B)\u2013(C) (petition for corrective action); \nid. \u00a7 1215(a)(1)(A)\u2013(C) (complaint for disciplinary action).  While the Special Counsel may \n\u201cconduct  an investigation\u201d to  determine  whether there  are reasonable  grounds to  believe  a \nprohibited personnel practice has occurred, id. \u00a7 1214(a)(5), he may not demand corrective action, \nhe must \u201cpetition\u201d the Merit Systems Protection Board and ask it to order it. \n39 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 40 of 67\nThe  Board  shall  order  such  corrective  action  as  the  Board  considers \nappropriate,  if  the  Board  determines  that  the  Special  Counsel  has \ndemonstrated that a prohibited personnel practice . . . has occurred, exists, \nor is to be taken . . . . [T]he Board shall order such corrective action as the \nBoard considers appropriate if the Special Counsel has demonstrated that a \ndisclosure  or  protected  activity . . . was  a  contributing  factor  in  the \npersonnel action which was taken or is to be taken against the individual.  \n \nId. \u00a7 1214(b)(4)(A)\u2013(B)(i).  The authority rests with the Board, then, to do what it considers \nappropriate.  See Am. Fed\u2019n of Gov\u2019t Emps., AFL-CIO v. O\u2019Connor, 747 F. 2d 748, 753 (D.C. Cir \n1984) (\u201c[T]he MSPB is free to disagree with the Special Counsel and often does.\u201d).  And if the \nSpecial Counsel is recommending disciplinary action against \u201can employee in a confidential, \npolicy-making, policy-determining, or policy-advocating position appointed by the President, by \nand with the advice of the Senate,\u201d the complaint must be presented to the President for appropriate \naction, not the MSPB.  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1215(b).  Again, it\u2019s not up to the Special Counsel; the President \nhas the last word. \n While like the Director of the CFPB, the Special Counsel plays a role in enforcing a \nnumber of separate statutory imperatives, the responsibility does not rest with him alone.  \nThe Special counsel may investigate allegations of violations of the Hatch Act as a more \ntypical law enforcement officer might do, id. \u00a7 1216(a), but if he finds that any of the enumerated \nconduct has occurred, he is only authorized to \u201cseek\u201d corrective action in the same manner as if a \nprohibited personnel practice was involved.  Id. \u00a7 1216(c).  The Special Counsel is authorized to \nhave access to the records of other agencies that are applicable to an inquiry he is conducting.  Id. \n\u00a7 1212(b)(5)(A).  But an Inspector General may withhold material if it contains information \npertaining to  intelligence activities, and the Attorney General  or an Inspector General  may \nwithhold  it  if  disclosure  could  interfere  with  an  ongoing  criminal  investigation.  Id. \n\u00a7 1212(b)(5)(B). \n40 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 41 of 67\nWhen it comes to whistleblower protections, while one may generally characterize the \nOSC\u2019s role as \u201cenforcing\u201d the rules against reprisals, the statute directs that the office shall \n\u201creceive, review, and where appropriate, forward to the Attorney General or an agency head\u201d \ndisclosures of violations of criminal conduct, the gross waste of funds, abuse of authority, or danger \nto public health or safety.  Id. \u00a7 1212(a)(3).  He is a conduit.  See id. \u00a7 1213(b), (c)(1)(A)\u2013(B), \n(f)(1)\u2013(2). \nEven if his review of disclosures leads him to determine that there is a substantial likelihood \nthat specifically identified forms of wrongdoing have occurred, his job is to \u201cpromptly transmit\u201d \nthe information to the appropriate agency head and write a report.  Id. \u00a7 1213(b), (c)(1)(A)\u2013(B).  \n \nThe rest of the Seila Law opinion points to constitutional concerns with the configuration \nof the CFPB that do not translate easily to the OSC.  It found that the CFPB\u2019s structure contravened \nthe Framers\u2019 insistence on a strong executive, which has been embodied in Article II.  But on what \nbasis? \nThe CFPB\u2019s single-Director structure contravenes this carefully calibrated \nsystem by vesting significant governmental power in the hands of a single \nindividual accountable to no one. The Director is neither elected by the \npeople nor meaningfully controlled (through the threat of removal) by \nsomeone who is . . . .  Yet the director may unilaterally, without meaningful \nsupervision, issue final regulations, oversee adjudications, set enforcement \npriorities, initiate prosecutions, and determine what penalties to impose on \nprivate parties. With no colleagues to persuade, and no boss to electorate \nlooking over her shoulder, the Director may direct and enforce policy for a \nvital segment of the economy affecting millions of Americans. \n \nSeila Law, 591 U.S. at 224\u201325 (emphasis in original).  If those circumstances were important to \nthe  determination  that  the  removal  restrictions  applicable  to  the  CFPB  Director  were \nunconstitutional, it is telling that the Special Counsel cannot do much of anything unilaterally.  He \ndoes not issue final regulations, oversee adjudications, initiate prosecutions, or determine what \npenalties to impose on private parties.  He most certainly does not \u201cdirect and enforce policy for a \n41 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 42 of 67\nvital segment of the economy affecting millions of Americans;\u201d he does not even \u201cdirect policy\u201d \naffecting the civil servants within his purview. \n  If one adopts the approach utilized in Seila Law and applies the criteria that were persuasive \nin that case, it becomes clear that the Special Counsel falls well within the \u201cfield of doubt\u201d \nHumphrey\u2019s Executor left for another day and outside the reach of Seila Law.  While he concedes \nthat he performs \u201csome\u201d executive functions, he cannot be described as a \u201cpurely executive \nofficer.\u201d  Nor does he \u201cwield significant executive powers,\u201d and unlike any of the agency heads \nthat have been the subject of Supreme Court consideration in the past, his role can hardly even be \ncharacterized as assisting the President in carrying out his duties.   \nThe defendants repeat the mantra that he \u201cinvestigates and prosecutes,\u201d but this effort to \nconjure up the image of a United States Attorney striding into court with the power to hold people \naccountable for their crimes is not an apt comparison.  The Special Counsel has a much more \nrestricted role.  While he is authorized to investigate certain forms of wrongdoing, he lacks real \nprosecutorial authority: his charter is to ensure that the rules of the federal workplace are followed, \nbut if an investigation reveals wrongdoing, he has to recommend that some other quasi-judicial or \nadministrative agency do something about it.  His tools are not grand juries or federal indictments; \nthe proceedings he seeks to initiate are civil, and not even civil actions in an Article III court, but \nonly complaints to be heard by an administrative agency, which can decline to pursue them.  He \ncan issue subpoenas to advance his investigation, but he cannot enforce them in court.  He has to \nask the MSPB to do that too.  5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1212(b)(3)(A), (B).  He can review and recommend \nagency regulations, but he has no policymaking authority if his suggestions fall on deaf ears.  Id. \n\u00a7 1212(a)(4).  If he is concerned that any Office of Personnel Management rule would require the \n42 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 43 of 67\ncommission of a prohibited personnel practice, he must file a complaint with the MSPB.  Id. \n\u00a7 1212(a)(4).   \n  Defendants quote the Supreme Court\u2019s comment about the head of the CFPB: \u201c[w]ith no \ncolleagues to persuade, and no boss or electorate looking over her shoulder,\u201d the Director could \n\u201cunilaterally\u201d \u201cdictate and enforce policy.\u201d  Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 8, quoting Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 225.  \nBut this selection from Seila Law demonstrates exactly why the cases are not analogous.  Unlike \nthe head of the CFPB, the Special Counsel has no authority to \u201cdictate\u201d policy, and for the most \npart, he cannot enforce it unilaterally either.  He must refer matters to the MSPB or make \nrecommendations to other agencies.  Moreover, since he stands alone, outside of the vast corps of \nofficials who actually \u201cassist [the President] in carrying out his duties,\u201d Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 204, \nciting Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 513\u201314, the restrictions on his removal do not conflict with \nthe general principles announced in Myers and Free Enterprise Fund. \nAlthough this Court does not consider plaintiff to be an inferior officer, the case is more \nakin to Morrison, in which the Court found that the removal protections did not unduly interfere \nwith the functioning of the executive branch because, in part, the independent counsel had \u201climited \njurisdiction and tenure and lacked policymaking or significant administrative authority.\u201d  Seila \nLaw, 591 U.S. at 217, quoting Morrison, 487 U.S. at 691.  If, as in that case, one considers the \nquestion posed by the Supreme Court \u2013 \u201cwhether a removal restriction is of such a nature that it \nimpedes the President\u2019s ability to perform his constitutional duty\u201d \u2013 the answer is no. \nFor all of these reasons, it appears to the Court that the removal restriction comports with \nSeila Law. \n  The decision in Collins v. Yellen does not require the invalidation of section 1211(b) either.\n  Collins  was  an  action  brought  by  shareholders  of  the  Federal  National  Mortgage \n43 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 44 of 67\nAssociation (\u201cFannie Mae\u201d) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (\u201cFreddie Mac\u201d) \nagainst the Federal Housing Finance Agency (\u201cFHFA\u201d).  594 U.S. at 235.  Like  the  CFPB,  the \nFHFA was established by Congress in the wake of the financial crisis in 2008, and it was authorized \nto oversee Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and to serve as a conservator or receiver if necessary, as \nboth had suffered significant losses due to the collapse of the housing market.  Id. at 226.  The \nshareholders  challenged  actions  taken  by  the  FHFA  in  its  role  as  conservator  and  the \nconstitutionality of the agency\u2019s structure.  An amicus was appointed to present arguments on \nbehalf of the agency head.  Id. at 236.  The Court held that the shareholders\u2019 claim was barred by \nHousing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008, 12 U.S.C. \u00a74627(f), but it addressed the separation \nof powers issue.   \nDefendants quote snippets from the ruling, but it is necessary to review the opinion as a \nwhole to understand what they mean.  Before reaching the merits, the Court detailed the wide-\nranging powers of the agency: \nThe  Agency  is  tasked  with  supervising  nearly  every  aspect  of  the \ncompanies\u2019 management and operations. For example, the Agency must \napprove any new products that the companies would like to offer. \u00a7 4541(a). \nIt may reject acquisitions and certain transfers of interests the companies \nseek  to  execute.  \u00a7  4513(a)(2)(A).  It  establishes  criteria  governing  the \ncompanies\u2019 portfolio holdings. \u00a7 4624(a). It may order the companies to \ndispose of or acquire any asset. \u00a7 4624(c). It may impose caps on how much \nthe companies compensate their executives and prohibit or limit golden \nparachute  and  indemnification  payments.  \u00a7  4518.  It  may  require  the \ncompanies  to  submit  regular  reports  on  their  condition  or  \u201cany  other \nrelevant topics.\u201d \u00a7 4514(a)(2). And it must conduct one on-site examination \nof the companies each year and may, on any terms the Director deems \nappropriate, hire outside firms to perform additional reviews. \u00a7\u00a7 4517(a)\u2013\n(b), 4519.  \n \nId. at 230. \nThe statute empowers the Agency with broad investigative and enforcement \nauthority to ensure compliance with these standards. Among other things, \nthe  Agency  may  hold  hearings,  \u00a7\u00a7  4582,  4633;  issue  subpoenas, \n44 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 45 of 67\n\u00a7\u00a7 4588(a)(3), 4641(a)(3); remove or suspend corporate officers, \u00a7 4636a; \nissue cease-and-desist orders, \u00a7\u00a7 4581, 4632; bring civil actions in federal \ncourt, \u00a7\u00a7 4584, 4635; and impose penalties ranging from $2,000 to $2 \nmillion per day, \u00a7\u00a7 4514(c)(2), 4585, 4636(b).  \nId. \n \nThe Recovery Act grants the FHFA expansive authority in its role as a \nconservator. As we have explained, the Agency is authorized to take control \nof a regulated entity\u2019s assets and operations, conduct business on its behalf, \nand transfer or sell any of its assets or liabilities. See \u00a7\u00a7 4617(b)(2)(B)\u2013(C), \n(G).   \n \nId. at 238\u201339. \n \nOnce it addressed whether the shareholders had standing to raise the constitutional issues, \nid. at 242\u201343, and that the removal restrictions at issue applied to the Director, but not the Acting \nDirector, id. at 250, the Collins opinion started with the proposition that the decision in Seila Law \nwas \u201call but dispositive.\u201d  Id.  The Court did not propose that it was necessary to revisit the analysis \nundertaken in the prior term; nor did it find it necessary to overturn any aspect of Seila Law or any \nof the authority upon which Seila Law was founded.  It stated that \u201c[a] straightforward application \nof our reasoning in Seila Law dictates the result here.\u201d  Collins, 594 U.S. at 251. \nThe opinion then considered each of the four arguments raised by the amicus in an effort \nto distinguish Seila Law, and it concluded that none of them was sufficient to call for a different \nresult.  First, the Court rebuffed the contention that Congress should have greater flexibility to \nrestrict the President\u2019s power to remove the FHFA director because the agency\u2019s authority is more \nlimited than that of the CFPB.  See Collins, 594 U.S. at 251.  It stated that \u201cthe nature and breadth \nof the agency\u2019s authority is not dispositive,\u201d and it elaborated on what it meant: \nThe President\u2019s removal power serves vital purposes even when the officer \nsubject to removal is not the head of one of the largest and most powerful \nagencies. The removal power helps the President maintain a degree of \ncontrol over the subordinates he needs to carry out his duties as the head of \nthe Executive Branch, and it works to ensure that these subordinates serve \n45 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 46 of 67\nthe people effectively and in accordance with the policies that the people \npresumably elected the  President to  promote . . . .  These purposes are \nimplicated whenever an agency does important work, and nothing about the \nsize or role of the FHFA convinces us that its Director should be treated \ndifferently from the Director of the CFPB.  \n \nId. at 252; see also id. at 253 (\u201c[W]hile the CFPB has direct regulatory and enforcement authority \nover purely private individuals and businesses, the FHFA has regulatory and enforcement authority \nover two companies that dominate the secondary mortgage market and have the power to reshape \nthe housing sector . . . .  FHFA actions with respect to those companies could have an immediate \nimpact on millions of private individuals and the economy at large.\u201d).  In short, the Court again \napplied the Seila Law principles to an agency that did in fact \u201cwield significant executive power.\u201d \nThe objective of these principles was to \u201censure that the President\u2019s subordinates serve the people \neffectively and in accordance with the policies that the people presumably elected the President to \npromote.\u201d  Id. at 252.  But as it has just been explained, that is not the Special Counsel\u2019s job.  He \npresents information to the President and can make recommendations to the President, but he is \nnot tasked with carrying his executive agenda. \nThe  Court  further  observed  that  \u201c[c]ourts  are  not  well-suited  to  weigh  the  relative \nimportance of the regulatory and enforcement authority of disparate agencies, and we do not think \nthat the constitutionality of removal restrictions hinges on such an inquiry.\u201d  Id. at 253. \nNext, the amicus posited that when the agency was acting as a conservator, it was \neffectively assuming the status of a private party and not exercising executive power.  Id. at \n253\u201354.  The court rejected that on the grounds that the agency does not always act as a \n \nconservator, and that even in that role, it is implementing a statutory scheme that accords it powers \nand responsibilities that ordinary conservators lack.  Id. at 254.  The Court did observe, though, \n46 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 47 of 67\nthat interpreting a law passed by Congress in an effort to implement it is, by definition, the \n\u201c\u2018execution\u2019 of the law.\u201d  Id., quoting Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 733 (1986). \nThird, the amicus maintained that the structure of the agency did not offend Article II \nbecause the regulated entities were \u201c[g]overnment-sponsored enterprises that have federal charters, \nserve public objectives, and receive special privileges like tax exemptions and certain borrowing \nrights.\u201d  Collins, 594 U.S. at 255 (internal quotations omitted).  The contention was that the \nconcerns underlying the limitations on removal power were inapplicable when the regulated bodies \nwere not purely private actors.  Id.   This, too, was found to be unpersuasive because \u201cthe \nPresident\u2019s removal power serves important purposes regardless of whether the agency in question \naffects ordinary Americans by directly regulating them or by taking actions that have a profound \nbut indirect effect on their lives.\u201d  Id. \n   The fourth argument was that the five-year tenure provided only \u201cmodest\u201d protection, as \nthe Director could be fired under the existing provisions for disobeying a lawful Presidential order. \nId. at 255\u201356.  The Court responded that even modest restrictions on the President\u2019s power are \nprohibited.  Id. at 256.  And it emphasized that, in its view, the President must be able to remove \nnot only officers who disobey his commands and who are negligent or inefficient, but \u201cthose who \nexercise their discretion in a way that is not intelligent or wise, those who have different views of \npolicy, and those who come from a competing political party who is dead set against the President\u2019s \n47 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 48 of 67\nagenda, and those in whom he has simply lost confidence.\u201d  Id. at 256 (internal quotation marks \nand citations omitted).19  \nBut the plaintiff is not relying on any of those contentions.  His point is not that his agency \nis smaller or that his regulatory and enforcement authority is less important.  He does not hang his \nhat on the fact that his term is \u201conly\u201d for five years.  He does not deny that he has some executive \nresponsibilities \u2013 after all, the Seila Law test is not whether the official exercises any executive \npower.  His point is that at bottom, while he has some executive-like functions, and that carrying \nout his duties of course entails \u201cexecuting\u201d the statute that established the position, he does not \nwield  significant  executive  power  because  he  lacks  real  ability  to  exercise  regulatory  or \nenforcement authority or decision-making; in almost every situation he encounters, the buck does \nnot  stop  with  him.    He  is,  primarily,  an  ombudsman  who  looks  into  complaints  and \n \n19   In a footnote in Collins, the Court addressed the warning by the amicus that a holding \nstriking down the removal restrictions in the Recovery Act could affect other agencies as well, \nnaming the Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d) and the Office of Special Counsel, among \nothers.  594 U.S. at 256, n. 21.  The Court observed that those agencies were not before it and \nchose not to comment on the constitutionality of any similar provisions that applied to them.  Id. \nAfter Collins was decided, the Office of Legal Counsel issued an opinion concluding that the \ndecisions in Seila Law and Collins necessitated a finding that the protections against removing the \nSSA Commissioner were unconstitutional.  Constitutionality of the Commissioner of Social \nSecurity\u2019s Tenure Protection, 45 Op. O.L.C. __, 1 (O.L.C. July 8, 2021).  But the OLC included \nan explicit caveat that this vindication of the President\u2019s Article II powers by the President\u2019s own \nlegal advisors did not necessarily extend to the Office of Special Counsel.  See id. at 10 n.3 (\u201cThis \nopinion does not address the validity of tenure protections conferred on the Special Counsel, whose \nremoval restrictions implicate different considerations . . . .\u201d).  Like the Supreme Court in Seila \nLaw, the opinion contrasted the SSA\u2019s impact on a large segment of the public, enormous budget, \nand  exceptionally  broad  rulemaking  authority  with  the  OSC\u2019s  ability  to  do  no  more  than \nrecommend regulatory changes.  Id. at 15, citing Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 217\u201318 (\u201cWe emphasize \nthe limited scope of our conclusion regarding the [SSA] Commissioner. It does not imply any \nsimilar determination with respect to the validity of tenure protections conferred on other executive \nofficials \u2013 for example, the Special Counsel, another single member agency head whose removal \nrestrictions implicate different considerations, such as the Special Counsel\u2019s primary investigative \nfunction and \u2018limited jurisdiction.\u2019\u201d).  \n48 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 49 of 67\nallegations \u2013 albeit with subpoena authority \u2013 and recommends that others, who do exercise \nexecutive or quasi-judicial authority, take action based on his findings.  And the OSC does not \neither \u201caffect ordinary Americans by directly regulating them or by taking actions that have a \nprofound but indirect effect on their lives.\u201d  Collins, 594 U.S. at 255 (emphasis added). \nPlaintiff does not invite the Court to weigh the relative importance of various agencies\u2019 \ncharters, as Collins said it shouldn\u2019t; the reason Seila Law is distinguishable is not because the \nagency is smaller or less important.  It is because that, while the OSC is bound to implement the \nstatutory directives imposed by Congress, it cannot fairly be likened to a typical administrative \nagency charged with implementing those directives in accordance with Presidential policy and \npriorities.  The Special Counsel is supposed to withstand the winds of political change and help \nensure that no government servant of either party becomes the subject of prohibited employment \npractices  or  faces  reprisals  for  calling  out  wrongdoing  \u2013  by  holdovers  from  a  previous \nadministration or by officials of the new one.20   \nIf Seila Law is to control a case involving the single head of an independent agency, as \nCollins said it should, it is essential to peek behind titles and labels and engage in this close \n \n20   Upholding the statutory restriction on removal in the absence of \u201cinefficiency, neglect of \nduty, or malfeasance in office\u201d does not give rise to the risk that a President could be stuck with a \nSpecial Counsel who is failing to fulfill the limited executive functions he does have.  Nothing in \nplaintiff\u2019s pleadings challenges the President\u2019s \u201cgeneral removal power,\u201d or the \u201cgeneral rule that \nthe President possesses \u2018the authority to remove those who assist him in carrying out his duties.\u2019\u201d \nSeila Law, 591 U.S. at 215, quoting Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 513\u201314.  Similarly, the statute \ndoes not leave the President in the situation that troubled the Court in Myers when it concluded \nthat the lack of the power to remove \u201cwould make it impossible for the President . . . to take care \nthat the laws be faithfully executed.\u201d  272 U.S. at 164.  Here, the statutory authority to remove the \nSpecial  Counsel  for  cause  enables  him  to  fulfill  that  directive,  while  also  preserving  the \nrequirement that the Special Counsel be insulated to some degree. \n \n49 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 50 of 67\nexamination of the particular position involved.  And it is important to note that this official has a \nsignificant obligation that distinguishes him from the heads of the other agencies discussed: the \nresponsibility to report his activities and findings not just to the President, but to Congress.   \nFinally, plaintiff fully recognizes that the removal provision he seeks to enforce could, as \nthe Court in Collins warned, bar the President from dismissing him on purely political grounds. \nBut, he maintains, that\u2019s as it should be.  The agency involved in Collins was qualitatively different \nfrom the Office of Special Counsel, which was specifically designed to serve a singular function \nfor which independence from partisan political interference is necessary.  The Court agrees and \nfinds that Collins does not require the invalidation of the statutory restrictions on removing the \nSpecial Counsel.  \n2.  The  history,  purpose,  and  nature  of  the  statute  demonstrate  that \nindependence from political or partisan interference is fundamental to \nthe Special Counsel. \nIt is notable that while the Supreme Court struck down the removal restrictions in the Seila \nLaw case, it found them to be severable from the rest of the Dodd-Frank Act and left it untouched. \n591 U.S. at 234\u201335.  There was nothing about those provisions that affected the operations or \nstructure of the CFPB, id. at 235, and their absence would not prevent the agency head from \nperforming her duties.  Indeed, the Supreme Court had concluded that the opposite was true: the \npresence of the restrictions interfered with the Director\u2019s inherent obligation to perform those \nduties on behalf of the executive and the President\u2019s ability to oversee her.  Id. at 223\u201326.  \nThe instant situation is entirely different.  Excising the provisions that protect the Special \nCounsel from dismissal for partisan or arbitrary reasons would cut straight to the heart of the \n50 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 51 of 67\nstatutory scheme: the Special Counsel\u2019s independence.  The term \u201cindependent agency\u201d is not \nsimply a label in this case; it is existential for the OSC.21    \nConsider how this all began.  President Carter proposed, and Congress created, the Special \nCounsel to protect the merits-based civil service system from \u201cimproper political influences or \npersonal favoritism,\u201d see President Carter Letter, and \u201cto protect individuals who speak out about \ngovernment wrongdoing from reprisals.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 2.  That merits-based system did \nnot always exist.  For nearly a century after the nation\u2019s founding, federal employment was plagued \nby a spoils system that permitted the President to treat a government job as an \u201citem of patronage\u201d \nto be rewarded to his partisan supporters only.  Arnett, 416 U.S. at 148.  Presidents across the \npolitical spectrum abused this power, until it resulted in the death of a sitting President, which \nspurred a movement for significant reform that would replace the patronage system entirely.     \nIn that context, it becomes clear why Congress, throughout its creation and refinement of \nthe position of Special Counsel, took pains to insulate him to some degree from the President.  The \nlegislature considered what the terms of the balance should be when it first created the position: \n\u201c[b]ecause the Special Counsel may be called upon to investigate prohibited personnel practices \nin the executive branch, and to bring disciplinary actions against executive branch officials,\u201d \nCongress \u201cbelieved it [was] essential that [he] be independent of presidential direction and \ncontrol.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 95-969, at 29.  But Congress did not deprive the President of all control over \nthe Special Counsel; it shortened the originally proposed seven-year term limit to five years, and \n \n21   This is true notwithstanding the Supreme Court\u2019s observation in Collins that \u201cdescribing \nan agency as independent would be an odd way to signify that its head is removable only for cause \nbecause even an agency head who is shielded that way would hardly be fully \u2018independent\u2019 of \nPresidential control.\u201d  594 U.S. at 249.  The invocation of the term in this case is not mean to \nsignify that the agency head is removable only for cause, but why. \n51 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 52 of 67\nit allowed the President to remove him for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.  \nSee Civil Services Reform Act of 1978, Pub. L. No. 95-454, 92 Stat 1111. \nLater, when Congress sought to expand the Special Counsel\u2019s responsibilities in the \nWhistleblower Protection Act, it worked with the President to define the boundaries of his new \nauthority.  Defendants attempt to cherry-pick history, to the extent they are familiar with it, by \nhighlighting certain constitutional objections to the Act voiced by the Office of Legal Counsel and \nPresident Reagan.  Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 3.  But not only do they neglect to mention that those objections \nwere to previous versions of the Act, they omit the fact that the executive branch then worked \nclosely with Congress to overcome the objections after considerable negotiation.  The legislative \nhistory, as a whole, tells a different story than the impression created by defendants\u2019 isolated \ncitations. \nPresident Reagan and his Attorney General took particular issue with the fact that the first \nWhistleblower Protection Act passed by Congress authorized the Special Counsel to obtain \njudicial review of Merits Systems Protection Board decisions because that would pit two executive \nagencies against each other in federal court.  See President Reagan Mem.  But once the President \nvetoed the original bill, Congress worked with the Attorney General to \u201cclip the Special Counsel\u2019s \nwings,\u201d 135 Cong. Rec. 5037 (1989) (statement of Rep. Pat Schroeder), by eliminating that \nauthority altogether.  135 Cong. Rec. 4509 (1989) (statement of Sen. Carl Levin).  After a process \nof negotiation, the same Attorney General, then serving under President George H. W. Bush, \napproved of the \u201cmutually acceptable resolution of [the] serious constitutional concerns,\u201d 135 \nCong.  Rec.  5033\u201334  (1989),  and  President  Bush  then  signed  the  reformed  Whistleblower \nProtection Act into law.  See President Bush Statement.                 \n52 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 53 of 67\nThat history, and the specific role the Office of Special Counsel was designed to play, \nunderlie and justify the presence of the removal restrictions in the statute.  As the Supreme Court \nhas observed: \nWhenever  called  upon  to  judge  the  constitutionality  of  an  Act  of \nCongress . . . the Court accords \u201cgreat weight to the decisions of Congress.\u201d  \nThe Congress is a coequal branch of government whose Members take the \nsame oath we do to uphold the Constitution of the United States. \n \nRostker v. Goldberg, 453 U.S. 57, 64 (1981), quoting Columbia Broad. Sys., Inc. v. Democratic \nNat\u2019l Comm., 412 U.S. 94, 102 (1973). \n  The Special Counsel\u2019s statutory duties and powers are set out fully above, and it bears \nrepeating that the terms of his  charter \u2013 the fact that he is authorized to investigate only certain \nforms of government wrongdoing, the lack of true prosecutorial authority, the remedies limited to \nmaking recommendations and complaints to other independent agencies with no right challenge \ntheir decisions, the absence of regulatory authority \u2013 were crafted by the executive and the \nlegislature working together.  Those limitations are why the OSC cannot be accurately described \nas a \u201csingle-Director structure\u201d that \u201cvest[s] significant governmental power in the hands of a \nsingle individual accountable to no one.\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 224.  It is also why the Special \nCounsel does not present the same constitutional threat as an official \u201c[w]ith no colleagues to \npersuade,\u201d who \u201cmay dictate and enforce policy . . . affecting millions of Americans.\u201d  Id. at 225.   \nCollins focuses attention on the \u201cvital purposes\u201d that are \u201cimplicated\u201d whenever the \nPresident\u2019s removal power is at issue.  Collins, 594 U.S. at 252.  As the Supreme Court has \ndescribed it, this specific aspect of a President\u2019s Article II power is coercive and controlling.  See \nHumphrey\u2019s Executor, 295 U.S. at 630 (describing the removal power as a \u201ccoercive influence\u201d).  \n\u201c[I]t is only the authority that can remove [executive] officials that they must fear and, in the \nperformance of [their] functions, obey\u201d the President.  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 213\u201314 (citation and \n53 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 54 of 67\nquotations omitted).  The general power of removal permits a President to fire officers \u201cwho \ndisobey his commands,\u201d \u201chave different views of policy,\u201d or \u201cwho come from a competing \npolitical party who is dead set against [the President\u2019s agenda].\u201d  Collins, 594 U.S. at 256 (citations \nand quotations omitted) \nSuch coercive influence would run directly contrary to the Special Counsel\u2019s unique status \nand mission.  The Special Counsel\u2019s independence ensures that he can fulfill his statutory duty to \nprotect whistleblowers within the federal government, who must feel free to report fraud, waste, \nand abuse or unlawful political activity without fear of retaliation.  It is his independence that \nqualifies him to watch over the time-tested structure that is supposed to bar executive officials \nfrom taking federal jobs from qualified individuals and handing them out to political allies \u2013 a \nsystem that Congress found intolerable over a century ago.  The position would be entirely \nineffective if the Special Counsel were to be compelled to operate with the sword of at-will \nremoval hanging over his head, or if a President, chagrined by whistleblower or merits system \nprotections could undermine the OSC\u2019s independence by threatening to use it.   \nThe Supreme Court imagined a scenario in which \u201can unlucky President\u201d might get \nelected on a specific platform and \u201center office only to find herself saddled with a holdover\u201d \nagency head \u201cwho is dead set against that agenda.\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 225 (emphasis in \noriginal).  But that possibility does not give rise to concerns for the President in the rare situation \npresented here.  The Office of Special Counsel does not have duties that can be characterized as \nimplementing an administration\u2019s agenda, and he cannot frustrate the President\u2019s policies; he \ncannot rewrite or reject regulations, and if he shines a light on wrongdoing, it is up to the \nadministration to choose to do something about it.  The scenario is constitutionally tolerable \nbecause it would not be faithful to the statute as written, or the bipartisan goals it is supposed to \n54 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 55 of 67\nadvance, if the Special Counsel himself is left to fear the very sort of reprisal his position is \ndesigned to prevent. \nII.  The Court will grant the plaintiff\u2019s request to impose equitable remedies in \nfurtherance of its judgment. \nPlaintiff asks the Court to declare that the February 7, 2025 termination was an unlawful, \nultra vires act, and therefore it is null and void and that he is the Special Counsel of the Office of \nSpecial Counsel for the remainder of his five year term unless and until he is removed in \naccordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a71211(b).  Pl.\u2019s Proposed Order [Dkt. # 23-2] at 2.  He also seeks an \norder directed to the subordinate executive branch officials named as defendants in this case that \nplaintiff must be recognized as the Special Counsel, that he must not be obstructed or denied the \nauthorities, benefits, and resources of his office, and that they may not recognize an Acting Special \nCounsel instead.  Id.  These requests fall well within the Court\u2019s jurisdiction, and they will be \ngranted in the order accompanying this opinion. \nA.  The Court has the authority to issue a declaratory judgment and enjoin \nexecutive officials other than the President. \n1.  Declaratory judgment \n28 U.S.C. \u00a72201(a) provides: \n[I]n a case of actual controversy within its jurisdiction, . . . any court of the \nUnited States, upon the filing of an appropriate pleading, may declare the \nrights  and  other  legal  relations  of  any  interest  ed  party  seeking  such \ndeclaration, whether or not further relief is or could be sought. Any such \ndeclaration shall have the force and effect of a final judgment or decree and \nshall be reviewable as such. \n \nThe defendants challenge the Court\u2019s power to issue a declaratory judgment directed \ntowards the President, on the grounds that it is at bottom an injunction, and therefore subject to the \ntraditional limits on the Court\u2019s equitable authority to enjoin the President.  Defs.\u2019 Reply at 9\u201310.  \nThis seems to ignore the salutary and clarifying effects of the merger of law and equity with the \n55 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 56 of 67\nadoption of the Federal Rules of Civil procedure in 1938, and the fact that Congress established \nthe declaration as a legal remedy in the Declaratory Judgment Act.   \n2.  Injunctive relief \nSince the entry of the TRO, defendants have marshalled considerable authority to support \ntheir position that the Court is not authorized to enjoin the President directly and order him to \nreinstate the plaintiff.  Plaintiff does not dispute this proposition.22  Instead, he has made it very \nclear in his submissions to date, see e.g., Reply in Supp. of Mot. for TRO at 7; Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 19; \nPl.\u2019s Reply at 3, and at the hearing, that he is not seeking an order directing the President to do or \nto stop doing anything.  He asks the Court, once it has entered its declaratory judgment, to direct \nthe other defendants, executive branch officials, to refrain from interfering with his status and \nactivities as the Special Counsel.  This is an order the Court has power to issue.   \nIn Youngstown Sheet & Tube Company v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579 (1952), the Supreme Court \nremedied the President\u2019s wrongful seizure of the nation\u2019s steel mills through an injunction to his \nsubordinates, and the case continues to be cited for the proposition that \u201ccourts have power to \ncompel subordinate executive officials to disobey illegal Presidential commands.\u201d  Soucie v. \nDavid, 448 F.2d 1067, 1072, n.12 (D.C. Cir. 1971). \nThe approach proposed by the plaintiff was discussed by the D.C. Circuit in Swan v. \nClinton, 100 F.3d 973, 980 (D.C. Cir. 1996).  In Swan, a member of the Board of the National \nCredit Union Administration had been removed by President Clinton, and he sought to have his \nremoval and replacement declared to be unlawful and to be reinstated.  Id. at 974.  Unlike in this \n \n22   See Severino v. Biden, 71 F.4th 1038 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (\u201c[E]njoining the President to make \na formal appointment\u201d is \u201ca constitutionally exceptional step,\u201d and \u201c[a] court generally may not \nenjoin the President in the performance of his official duties.\u201d  Id. at 1042 (internal quotation marks \nomitted), citing Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 802 (1992). \n56 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 57 of 67\ncase, the removal did not contravene the applicable statute since Swan\u2019s term had expired, and he \nwas a holdover Board member when he was replaced.  See id. at 975.  In addressing its own subject \nmatter jurisdiction to hear the case and decide that point, the Court considered the question of the \nredressability of plaintiff\u2019s injury, and the availability of an injunction as relief came up in that \ncontext.  \n[I]njunctive  relief  against  the  President  personally  is  an  extraordinary \nmeasure not lightly to be undertaken. The reasons why courts should be \nhesitant  to  grant  such  relief  are  painfully  obvious;  the  President,  like \nCongress, is a coequal branch of government, and for the President to be \nordered to perform particular executive acts at the behest of the Judiciary at \nbest creates an unseemly appearance of constitutional tension and at worst \nrisks a violation of the constitutional separation of powers. \n \nOn the other side of the scale, of course, is the bedrock principle that our \nsystem of government is founded on the rule of law, and it is sometimes a \nnecessary function of the judiciary to determine if the executive branch is \nabiding by the terms of legislative enactments. In most cases, any conflict \nbetween the desire to avoid confronting the elected head of a coequal branch \nof government and to ensure the rule of law can be successfully bypassed, \nbecause the injury at issue can be rectified by injunctive relief against \nsubordinate officials.  \n \nId. at 978 (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).  The Court decided that in Swan\u2019s \nsituation, the remedy could come in the form of an injunction directed towards the executive \ndirector of the Board.  Id. at 980.  In his concurring opinion, Judge Lawrence Silberman chided \nthe majority for its lengthy consideration of its authority to direct the President to rehire someone \nin a case in which the firing at issue was not unlawful in the first place.  See id. at 989\u201391 \n(Silberman, J., concurring).  But he agreed that if the Court had found that the plaintiff should \nremain in the position, the better course would be to simply order the other executive branch \nofficials to recognize his status.  Id. at 988\u201389.  The Circuit later repeated that a court can \u201cenjoin \n57 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 58 of 67\n\u2018subordinate executive officials\u2019 to reinstate a wrongly terminated official \u2018de facto\u2019\u201d to redress \nthe official\u2019s injury.  Severino, 71 F.4th at 1042\u201343, quoting Swan, 100 F. 3d. at 980.23  \nFinally,  to  support  their  argument  that  plaintiff  is  not  entitled  to  injunctive  relief, \ndefendants point to a line of cases in which federal officials removed from their positions pursued \nsuits for back pay.  See Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 16.  While it is true that the plaintiffs in Shurtleff v. United \nStates, 189 U.S. 311 (1903), Myers, 272 U.S. 52, Humphrey\u2019s Executor, 295 U.S. 602, and Wiener \nv. United States, 357 U.S. 349 (1958), were seeking to recover monetary compensation, none of \nthose cases stands for or even purported to address the proposition that no the other remedy was \navailable.24  The issue in Shurtleff was whether the President could remove an officer \u201cfor any \nother causes other than those mentioned\u201d in a for-cause removal restriction.  189 U.S. at 314.  \nMyers addressed whether the President could remove a postmaster without the consent of the \n \n23   Plaintiff also suggests that a writ of mandamus might be available to order the other \ngovernment officials to perform a purely ministerial act, citing Severino v. Biden, 71 F.4th 1038.  \nSee Tr. at 25.  During the redressability analysis in that case, the Court again reviewed what might \nbe possible, and it observed that Franklin v. Massachusetts, 505 U.S. at 788, \u201cleft open a narrow \npotential exception for injunctions that require the President to perform a \u2018purely \u201cministerial\u201d \nduty\u2019 over which he has no discretion.\u201d  As in Swan, the Court chose not to tackle the question of \nwhether, under its precedent, an injunction to reinstate an official could qualify as \u201cministerial.\u201d  \nId.  While there is no need to address the question with respect to the President since plaintiff is \nnot asking that he be joined, the Court has similar qualms about whether acquiescing in Dellinger\u2019s \nstatus and refraining from interfering with the performance of his duties for five years could be \nclassified as \u201cministerial,\u201d so it will leave the question of mandamus for another day.  \n \n24   Defendants also point to Parsons v. United States, 167 U.S. 324 (1897), describing it as a \nsuit for \u201csalary and fees,\u201d Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 16, but that description does not tell the whole story.  In \nthat case, when President Grover Cleveland attempted to remove the United States Attorney for \nthe Northern and Middle District of Alabama without cause, the U.S. Attorney \u201crespectfully \ndecline[d] to surrender the office.\u201d  Id. at 325.  The individual President Cleveland had named as \nsuccessor then sued the U.S. Attorney to require him to \u201cturn over . . . all the books and papers and \nother property appertaining to the office.\u201d  Id. at 326.  After the successor won in the lower court, \nthe deposed U.S. Attorney filed a petition for a writ mandamus in the Supreme Court to vacate the \norder, and that petition also sought the recovery of \u201csalary and fees.\u201d  Id.      \n \n58 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 59 of 67\nSenate.  272 U.S. at 107\u201308, 109.  Reinstatement was not an issue since Myers was deceased.  See \nid. at 106.  Humphrey\u2019s Executor determined whether for-cause removal protection for the \nCommissioners of the Federal Trade Commission violated the President\u2019s removal power, and as \nin Myers, the case was being pursued after his death.  295 U.S. at 618\u201319.  And Weiner \n\u201cpresent[ed] a variant of the constitutional issue\u201d in Humphrey\u2019s, addressing whether the President \ncould remove a member of the quasi-judicial War Claims Commission.  Weiner, 357 U.S. at 350\u2013\n51.  Reinstatement was not an issue because Congress abolished the Commission before the case \nwas resolved.  See id. at 350. \nSo the Court finds it proper to enjoin defendants Bessent, Gor, Gorman, Kamman, and \nVought, ordering them to recognize plaintiff Dellinger\u2019s authority as Special Counsel unless and \nuntil he is removed in accordance with 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b). 25  \n \n25   Defendants cite White v. Berry, 171 U.S. 366 (1898), Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 1, in which the U.S. \nCollector of Internal Revenue removed an official who had been appointed to a position by the \nSecretary of the Treasury, because he was a Democrat and the Collector wanted to replace him \nwith a republican.   Id. at 366\u201367.  The lower court held that the removal violated the Pendleton \nCivil Service Act and that it had the authority to \u201cto restrain the appointing power from removing\u201d \nthe plaintiff because it was unlawful.  Id. at 376.  The Supreme Court found it to be \u201cwell settled \nthat a court of equity has no jurisdiction over the appointment and removal of public officers,\u201d id. \nat 377, and it vacated the order.  But it confirmed that \u201c[t]he jurisdiction to determine the title to a \npublic office belongs exclusively to the courts of law.\u201d  Id.  This reaffirms the Court\u2019s power to \nissue declaratory relief, but it does not bear on the requested injunction since plaintiff is not \nrequesting an order that anyone be removed or reinstated.  White v. Berry is relevant in that the \nSupreme Court plainly recognized that the power to remove or replace officials had regularly been \nexercised by courts throughout the country\u2019s history, albeit in a manner that honored the then-\nexisting separation between courts of law and courts of equity:  \u201ceither by certiorari, error, or \nappeal, or by mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto, or information in the nature of a writ of quo \nwarranto, according to the circumstances of the case, and the mode of procedure established by \ncommon law or by statute.\u201d  Id.  In short, there are many parallels to remedies that have been \nawarded in the past.  Plaintiff has cited a line of authorities in which the quo warranto procedure \nwas utilized to resolve disputes over title to an office, see Reply in Supp. of Mot. for TRO at 7, \nand Pl.\u2019s Reply at 4, n.3, and the Court agrees that his prayer for relief is sufficiently broad to \nencompass a request for this or another form of legal relief if recharacterizing it is necessary, \nespecially since the Court is not ordering that anyone be appointed or removed. \n59 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 60 of 67\nB.  The permanent injunction factors support the issuance of an injunction. \nA plaintiff seeking a permanent injunction must demonstrate that:  (1) he has suffered an \nirreparable injury; (2) remedies available at law, such as monetary damages, are inadequate to \ncompensate for that injury; (3) considering the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and \ndefendant, a remedy in equity is warranted; and (4) the public interest would not be disserved by \na permanent injunction.  Monsanto Co., 561 U.S. at 156\u201357, quoting eBay Inc., 547 U.S. at 391.  \n\u201cThe decision to grant or deny permanent injunctive relief is an act of equitable discretion by the \ndistrict court.  eBay, 547 U.S. at 391.  \u201cThe purpose of an injunction is to prevent future violations\u201d \nwhere there is \u201ccognizable danger of recurrent violation.\u201d Anatol Zukerman & Charles Krause \nReporting, LLC v. U.S. Postal Serv., 64 F.4th 1354, 1363\u201364 (D.C. Cir. 2023), quoting, United \nStates v. W.T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 633 (1953).  But \u201c[i]f a less drastic remedy\u201d is \u201csufficient \nto redress\u201d the injury, the \u201cextraordinary relief of an injunction\u201d is not warranted.  Monsanto Co., \n561 U.S. at 165\u201366.   \n1.  Irreparable Harm and Inadequate Remedy at Law \nPlaintiff reminds the Court that his motion for a temporary relief argued that removal would \ncause him irreparable harm by depriving him of his \u201cstatutory right to function in his office,\u201d which \ncould not be remedied by a post-judgment award of damages.  Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 27\u201328.  It is now the \nstage where judgment is being awarded, so the option of deferring injunctive relief because the \nproblem can be remedied later is no longer available, and the Court did not find that adequate at \nthe outset of the lawsuit anyway.  See TRO Order at 20\u201321.  Because at this point in the \nproceedings, there is substantial overlap between the claimed irreparable injury and the lack of an \nadequate remedy at law, the Court will consider these two factors together, as other courts in this \n60 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 61 of 67\ndistrict have done.  See, e.g., Ridgley v. Lew, 55 F. Supp. 3d 89, 98 (D.D.C. 2014); Kymber \nConsulting Grp., LLC. v. Cato, No. 22-1042 (JMC), 2022 WL 7488185, at *3 (D.D.C. 2022).          \n  As the Court of Appeals has explained, \u201c[m]ere injuries, however substantial, in terms of \nmoney, time and energy necessarily expended in the absence of a stay are not enough\u201d to prove \nirreparable harm.  Wisc. Gas Co. v. FERC, 758 F.2d 669, 674 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (per curiam), \nquoting Va. Petroleum Jobbers Ass\u2019n v. FPC, 259 F.2d 921, 925 (D.C. Cir. 1958).26   \n  Plaintiff has made a sufficient showing of irreparable harm that cannot be remediated \nthrough a damages award.  As the Court has explained, unless he is removed for inefficiency, \nneglect of duty, or malfeasance, plaintiff has a statutory duty to fulfill:  to \u201cprotect employees, \nformer employees, and applicants for employment from prohibited personnel practices.\u201d 5 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1212(a)(1).  The purported removal without cause renders him unable to fulfill that duty, a loss \nthat can never be restored, and therefore it gives rise to irreparable harm.  And as plaintiff \npredicted, the harm he feared was impending was not mere speculation; defendants compounded \nthe problem when they notified the Court, the President has already \u201cdesignated the Secretary of \nVeteran Affairs, Doug Collins, to serve as Acting Special Counsel,\u201d during the pendency of the \nCourt\u2019s proceedings.  Notice of Designation at 1.   \n  Defendants\u2019 contentions with respect to this factor are unpersuasive.  They tend to repeat \nthe  arguments  they  made  against  the  TRO,  characterizing  plaintiff\u2019s  injury  as  a  loss  of \n\u201cemployment and salary\u201d and then asserting that it is not irreparable because \u201c[a] court can \ngenerally repair an injury to an individual from loss of employment by awarding post judgment \n \n26   Defendants cite Chaplaincy of Full Gospel Churches v. England, 454 F.3d 290 (D.C. Cir. \n2006) for their argument that plaintiff does not meet the \u201chigh standard for irreparable injury.\u201d  \nDefs.\u2019 Mot. at 20 (quotations omitted).  But that case addresses the test for interim relief, not \nwhether an injunction would be appropriate after litigation concludes.  Id. at 293.   \n61 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 62 of 67\nrelief such as backpay.\u201d  Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 20; Defs.\u2019 Reply at 12.  Plaintiff has never even brought \nup the subject of his salary.   \nDefendants rely on Sampson v. Murray, 415 U.S. 61, 83 (1974), as they did at the TRO \nstage.  Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 20.  The Court addressed Sampson in its order granting the TRO.  See TRO \nOrder at 17\u201324.  Sampson involved a probationary employee who sought to enjoin the General \nServices Administration from discharging her, arguing that the discharge would cause irreparable \nharm by depriving her of income and causing \u201cher to suffer the embarrassment of being wrongfully \ndischarged.\u201d 415 U.S. at 62\u201363, 66. The allegations themselves differentiate that case from this \none. Sampson also acknowledged that its analysis was \u201cdealing\u201d with a particular class of \nemployee \u2013 a \u201cprobationary\u201d one.  Id. at 80\u201381.  And while it rejected injunctive relief in her \nsituation, it made it clear it was not shutting the door entirely:     \n[C]ases may arise in which the circumstances surrounding an employee\u2019s \ndischarge, together with the resultant effect on the employee, may so far \ndepart from the normal situation that irreparable injury might be found. \nSuch extraordinary cases are hard to define in advance of their occurrence \n. . . .  [W]e do not wish to be understood as foreclosing relief in the \ngenuinely extraordinary situation.  Use of the court\u2019s injunctive power, \nhowever, when discharge of probationary employees is an issue, should be \nreserved for that situation rather than employed in the routine case. \n  \nId. at 92 n.68. \n  This is not a routine case dealing with a terminated probationary employee.  Plaintiff \nDellinger was appointed to serve a statutory term of five years, which he was doing until his \nsudden, unexplained removal.  Ex. A.  And he is not claiming the same irreparable injury as the \nSampson plaintiff, nor could his claimed injury \u2013 deprivation of his statutory right to function \u2013 be \ncompared to the loss of income or embarrassment involved in the typical employment action, for \nwhich there are remedies that do not involve equitable relief.  As the Court stated in the temporary \nrestraining order: \n62 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 63 of 67\nThis  case  falls  outside  of  the  typical  paradigm  since  the  OSC  is  an \nindependent agency and the White House is not plaintiff\u2019s employer. In \nshort, plaintiff\u2019s injury stems directly from \u201cextraordinary\u201d circumstances \nas Sampson requires; namely, that for the first time, a President has removed \nthe Special Counsel from his statutorily prescribed term without any cause \nor explanation. \n \nTRO Order at 19.   \n  Defendants now point to Raines v. Byrd, 521 U.S. 811 (1997), as well, and they argue that \n\u201closs of political power\u201d is not a cognizable harm.  Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 20.  But Raines is not on point.  \nIn Raines, six members of Congress sued the Secretary of the Treasury and the Office of \nManagement and Budget to challenge the constitutionality of the Line-Item Veto Act, which \nauthorized the President to \u201c\u2018cancel\u2019 certain spending and tax benefits measures after he . . . signed \nthem into law.\u201d  Id. at 814.  The plaintiffs had voted against the Act, id., and, for standing purposes, \nalleged that the law injured them by:  (1) altering the legal and practical effect of all votes they \nmay cast on bills with vetoable items;  (2) divesting them of their constitutional role in the repeal \nof legislation; and (3) altering the constitutional balance of powers between the legislative and \nexecutive branches.  Id. at 816.  The Court held that none of these injuries were sufficient for \nstanding because the fact that they had \u201csimply lost\u201d the vote on the Line-Item Veto Act did not \nimplicate the invasion of legally protected interest to give rise to the necessary injury-in fact.  Id. \nat 827\u201329.   \nPlaintiff Dellinger is not a member of Congress, this case does not involve a single vote, \nno one has challenged plaintiff\u2019s standing, and he does not assert a reduction of his \u201cpolitical \npower.\u201d  Plaintiff was injured by the deprivation of his statutory right to function at all when the \nPresident attempted to remove him without cause.   \nDefendants also assert that the dissent in Barnes v. Kline, 759 F.2d 21 (D.C. Cir. 1984), \nvacated on other grounds, 479 U.S. 361 (1987), supports the argument that public officials do not \n63 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 64 of 67\nhave a \u201cseparate private right\u201d to their office.  Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 20, citing Barnes, 759 F.2d at 50 \n(Bork, J., dissenting).  As the reliance on a dissent tends to signal, Barnes does not support their \nposition.  In that case, thirty-three members of Congress sued two executive officials to challenge \nthe constitutionality of the President\u2019s \u201cpocket veto\u201d power, which President Reagan had exercised \nto veto the International Security and Development Co-operation Act.  Id. at 23\u201324.  The D.C. \nCircuit held that the plaintiffs \u201cclearly ha[d] standing to litigate\u201d the case, over the dissent by Judge \nBork cited by defendants.  Id. at 29.  So, that case does not provide much support either, and the \nprinciple it is cited to advance is undermined by defendants\u2019 simultaneous insistence that plaintiff \nis not entitled to an injunction because he could sue for backpay damages.  See Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 16\u2013\n17 (citing five previous Supreme Court cases in which removed officers were allowed to bring suit \nover their removal). \nThe Court finds that plaintiff has demonstrated both that he would suffer irreparable harm \nin the absence of injunctive relief and that he lacks an adequate remedy at law.   \n2.  Balance of the Equities and Public Interest \nThe next set of factors are whether the balance of hardships between the plaintiff and \ndefendant warrants an equitable remedy, and whether the injunction serves the public interest.  \nMonsanto Co., 561 U.S. at 157.  As they did at the TRO stage, both parties advance the arguments \nconcerning these factors together.  See Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 21\u201323; Pl.\u2019s Mot. at 28\u201329.  Because the \nCourt finds that they are intertwined, and the Supreme Court has instructed that \u201cassessing the \nharm to the opposing party and weighing the public interest . . . merge when the [g]overnment is \nthe opposing party,\u201d Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009), the Court will consider them \ntogether.     \n64 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 65 of 67\nThe Department of Justice wrings its hands over the harm that could flow from what it calls \na \u201cspecial exception for the Special Counsel\u201d to the President\u2019s Article II power, Defs.\u2019 Mot. at 8, \nasserting that this inflicts harm on the President by depriving him of \u201ccontrol over an entire \nexecutive department.\u201d  Defs\u2019 Reply at 12.  But plaintiff is not seeking to be excepted from binding \ncase authorities; his position is that the OSC was not covered by them in the first place.  See Tr. at \n4\u20135.  Moreover, the instant decision is extremely narrow and sui generis, and it does not result in \nthe diminution of the President\u2019s powers; this is the only single-headed agency left for the courts \nto consider, and it is unlike any of them.  Thus, recognizing the unique nature of the OSC will be \nno threat to the Framers\u2019 decision, made manifest in Article II, to make \u201ca single President \nresponsible for the actions of the Executive Branch.\u201d  Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 224, citing Free \nEnter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 477.  \n On the other side of the equation, one cannot deny the proposition that the Special \nCounsel\u2019s singular role, and preserving his independence in carrying it out, advance the public \ninterest.  That was the genesis of the Whistleblower Protection Act and the particular provisions \nat issue.  The protection the OSC offers to enable whistleblowers to come forward with information \nabout wrongdoing without fear of reprisal is critical to ensuring that those instances of wrongdoing \nare corrected, to the benefit of both the government and the public at large.  Both houses of \nCongress  have consistently  emphasized the need for robust support for whistleblowers; for \nexample, on July 30, 2023, the Senate passed a resolution introduced by Senator Chuck Grassley \n(R-Iowa) designating the date as \u201cNational Whistleblower Day.\u201d  S. Res. 793, 118th Cong. (July \n31, 2023).  The resolution was a reminder that: \n[W]histleblowers  risk  their  careers,  jobs,  and  reputations  by  reporting \nwaste, fraud, and abuse to the proper authorities . . . .  [I]n providing the \nproper  authorities  with  lawful  disclosures,  whistleblowers  save  the \ntaxpayers of the United States billions of dollars each year and serve the \n65 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 66 of 67\npublic interest by ensuring that the United States remains an ethical and safe \nplace[.] \n \nId. at 2.  The benefits of a duly appointed Special Counsel, operating free of partisan pressure far \noutweigh any harms identified by the defendants. \nThe Court is therefore skeptical of defendants\u2019 assertion that \u201cthe public would be better \nserved by the appointment of a principal officer who holds the President\u2019s confidence.\u201d  Defs.\u2019 \nMot. at 22.  There has been no indication here that plaintiff has been acting in a partisan or biased \nmanner; to the contrary, for example, his recent finding vindicating complaints by IRS agents that \nwere retaliated against for raising concerns about the treatment of Hunter Biden during President \nBiden\u2019s administration spurred Senators Charles Grassley and Ron Johnson to implore President \nTrump  to  protect  those  individuals.    Letter from  Senator  Charles  E.  Grassley,  Chairman \nCommittee  on  the  Judiciary,  and  Ron  Johnson,  Chairman,  Permanent  Subcommittee  on \nInvestigations to President Donald J. Trump (Feb. 6, 2025), http://www.grassley.senate.gov/ \nimo/media/doc/grassley_johnson_to_trump_-_irs_whistleblower_retaliation.pdf.  That happened \njust one day before plaintiff\u2019s purported termination.  And the suggestion that the public is \nnecessarily better served by the President\u2019s choice runs contrary to the Court\u2019s earlier findings \nabout the critical importance of independence in this particular position.  Moreover, it is enough \nto satisfy the final two factors when considering a permanent injunction to find that an injunction \nto preserve the status quo of plaintiff\u2019s position does not harm the public, and therefore, the \npotential that a President may have qualms that fall far short of the statutory reasons for dismissal \ndoes not counsel against relief.    \n \n \n \n66 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 32     Filed 03/01/25     Page 67 of 67\nCONCLUSION \nFor all of the reasons set forth above, the Court will enter judgment in favor of plaintiff on \nCount One, and it will award the declaratory and injunctive relief set forth in the accompanying \norder. \n \nAMY BERMAN JACKSON \nUnited States District Judge \n \nDATE:  March 1, 2025  \n67 \n \n\nCase 1:25-cv-00385-ABJ     Document 33     Filed 03/01/25     Page 1 of 2\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA \n \n____________________________________ \n) \nHAMPTON DELLINGER  ) \nin his personal capacity and   ) \nin his official capacity as   ) \nSpecial Counsel of the   ) \nOffice of Special Counsel,  ) \n) \nPlaintiff,  ) \n)  Civil Action No. 25-0385 (ABJ) \nv.  )   \n) \nSCOTT BESSENT  ) \nin his official capacity as   ) \nSecretary of the Treasury, et al.,  ) \n) \nDefendants.  ) \n____________________________________) \n \nORDER \nPursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 56 and 58 and for the reasons stated in the \naccompanying Memorandum Opinion [Dkt. # 32], it is hereby ORDERED that plaintiff\u2019s motion \nfor summary judgment and motion for a permanent injunction [Dkt. # 23] is GRANTED, and the \nCourt hereby enters judgment in favor of plaintiff on Count One.

Pending before the Court is plaintiff's motion for a Temporary Restraining Order 2. The Court received the motion shortly after it was docketed and assigned this morning, and it was occupied with another hearing for most of the day, so it set a scheduling conference for 4:30 p.m. At the hearing, counsel for the defendants represented that they did not receive the motion until the early afternoon and had not yet had an opportunity to file a response. Counsel also indicated that the defendants were unable to take a position as to whether they would be willing to freeze the firing until the Court resolved the legal issues. The Court heard some argument from both sides with respect to the factors it must consider in connection with the motion, and it appreciates the fact that the lawyers were both ready to address them orally, at least in part, this afternoon. But the Court has not yet had the benefit of a written submission by the defendants. Therefore, the defendants' opposition to the motion will be due by noon tomorrow, February 11, 2025. Give the Court's concerns about the potential irreparable harm occasioned by the challenged firing of the Special Counsel, a Presidential appointee confirmed by the Senate to serve a 5-year term who \"may be removed by the President only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance,\" 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 1211(b), and given the significant statutory and constitutional issues involved, the Court will defer ruling on the motion until after it has received and considered the defendants' submission. In the interim, though, to preserve the status quo -- which the D.C. Circuit has described as \"the regime in place\" before the challenged action, Huisha-Huisha v. Mayorkas, 27 F.4th 718, 733-34 (D.C. Cir. 2022), or \"the last uncontested status which preceded the pending controversy,\" id., quoting District 50, United Mine Workers of America v. International Union, United Mine Workers of America, 412 F.2d 165, 168 (D.C. Cir. 1969) -- the Court will issue a brief administrative stay. An administrative stay \"buys the court time to deliberate\": it \"do[es] not typically reflect the court's consideration of the merits,\" but instead \"reflects a first-blush judgment about the relative consequences\" of the case. United States v. Texas, 144 S. Ct. 797, 798 (2024) (Barret, J., concurring). While administrative stays are more common in appellate courts, district courts have recognized their applicability in cases seeking emergency relief - including in this District. See National Council of Nonprofits v. Office of Management & Budget, No. 25-CV-239, 2025 WL 314433 (D.D.C. Jan. 28, 2025); Order, Texas v. Department of Homeland Security, No. 24-CV-306 (E.D. Tex. Aug. 26, 2024); Chef Time 1520 LLC v. Small Business Administration, No. 22-CV-3587 (D.D.C. Dec. 1, 2022). As these courts have recognized, the \"[t]he authority for an administrative stay arises from the All Writs Act and a court's inherent authority to manage its docket.\" Order, Texas, No. 24-CV-306, at 2. Therefore, it is HEREBY ORDERED that from the time of this order through midnight on February 13, 2025, plaintiff Hampton Dellinger shall continue to serve as the Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel, the position he occupied at 7:22 p.m. on Friday, February 7, 2025 when he received an email from the President, and the defendants may not deny him access to the resources or materials of that office or recognize the authority of any other person as Special Counsel. This period may only be extended by further order of the Court. SO ORDERED. Signed by Judge Amy Berman Jackson on 2/10/2025.

An administrative stay \"buys the court time to deliberate\": it \"do[es] not typically reflect the court's consideration of the merits,\" but instead \"reflects a first-blush judgment about the relative consequences\" of the case. United States v. Texas, 144 S. Ct. 797, 798 (2024) (Barret, J., concurring). While administrative stays are more common in appellate courts, district courts have recognized their applicability in cases seeking emergency relief - including in this District. See National Council of Nonprofits v. Office of Management & Budget, No. 25-CV-239, 2025 WL 314433 (D.D.C. Jan. 28, 2025); Order, Texas v. Department of Homeland Security, No. 24-CV-306 (E.D. Tex. Aug. 26, 2024); Chef Time 1520 LLC v. Small Business Administration, No. 22-CV-3587 (D.D.C. Dec. 1, 2022). As these courts have recognized, the \"[t]he authority for an administrative stay arises from the All Writs Act and a court's inherent authority to manage its docket.\" Order, Texas, No. 24-CV-306, at 2. Therefore, it is HEREBY ORDERED that from the time of this order through midnight on February 13, 2025, plaintiff Hampton Dellinger shall continue to serve as the Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel, the position he occupied at 7:22 p.m. on Friday, February 7, 2025 when he received an email from the President, and the defendants may not deny him access to the resources or materials of that office or recognize the authority of any other person as Special Counsel. This period may only be extended by further order of the Court. SO ORDERED. Signed by Judge Amy Berman Jackson on 2/10/2025.

In light of the joint status report 20, plaintiff's 10-page reply to the opposition to his motion for a temporary restraining order, now deemed to be a motion for a preliminary injunction, will be due on February 20, 2025. In the absence of opposition on the part of either party, it is hereby further ORDERED that the Court's consideration of the motion for preliminary injunction will be consolidated with consideration of the merits pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2). This means that additional submissions are necessary, even if just for procedural purposes. Defendants' motion for summary judgment is due on February 21, 2025. Plaintiff's opposition, and his cross-motion for summary judgment, if any, to be supported by a single, combined memorandum of points and authorities, will be due on February 24, 2025. Defendants' reply, combined with their opposition to plaintiff's cross-motion, if necessary, is due on February 25, 2025. Plaintiff's reply in support of his cross-motion, if necessary, is due on February 27, 2025. Rather than re-submitting identical briefs, the parties may state in their motions that they are incorporating or relying on previously filed memoranda in support of or in opposition to the temporary restraining order as the memoranda supporting or opposing the motions for summary judgment, but they are not required to do so.

Movant has not made a showing that he satisfies the requirements to intervene as of right under Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 24(a) because: (1) he is not given an unconditional right to intervene by any federal statute, and (2) he does not claim an interest relating to any property of transaction that is the subject of the action and is not so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest. Movant has also not shown that the Court should exercise its discretion to grant permissive intervention under Rule 24(b)(1), since: (A) he is not given a conditional right to intervene by any federal statute, and (B) he does not have a claim or defense that shares a common question of law or fact with the main action. The issue before the Court is whether the effort to terminate the Special Counsel's position without identifying a reason comports with the relevant statute, 5 U.S.C.\u00a7 1211(b), and whether that statute is constitutional. Those are questions of law, not fact. The Court understands that the movant has an opinion, based on the handling of a matter in which he was involved, concerning the Special Counsel's performance of his duties, but given the issues to be resolved in this case, movant's personal experience and opinion do not bear on the resolution of the purely legal issues presented. SO ORDERED. Signed by Judge Amy Berman Jackson on 2/28/25.

Movant has not made a showing that he satisfies the requirements to intervene as of right under Fed. R. Civ. Proc. 24(a) because: (1) he is not given an unconditional right to intervene by any federal statute, and (2) he does not claim an interest relating to any property of transaction that is the subject of the action and is not so situated that disposing of the action may as a practical matter impair or impede his ability to protect that interest.

The issue before the Court is whether the effort to terminate the Special Counsel's position without identifying a reason comports with the relevant statute, 5 U.S.C.\u00a7 1211(b), and whether that statute is constitutional. Those are questions of law, not fact, and movant's other matters do not bear on those questions. With respect to the motion for joinder, \"[i]ntervention is used by a person who is outside the litigation and wishes to join it, while permissive joinder is initiated by a person who is already a party to the proceeding and wishes to bring in another party.\" 25 Fed. Proc., L. Ed. \u00a7 59:164; see Fed. R. Civ. Pro. 20. Because movant is not a party to this proceeding, joinder does not apply. For these reasons, the motion for intervention and the motion for joinder are hereby DENIED. Further, given that the movant has sent multiple, subsequent, duplicative filings to the court, which are insufficient for the same reasons, and that and that court staff have fielded multiple daily calls and emails from him, the Clerk of Court is direct not to accept any further filings from this movant.
