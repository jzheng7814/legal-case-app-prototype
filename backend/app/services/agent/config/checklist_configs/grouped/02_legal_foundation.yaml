  Extract all 3 checklist items from the legal case documents as completely as possible.

# Task-specific constraints
constraints:
  - "Extract EVERY distinct value of each checklist item that directly matches the item's definition."
  - "When multiple values exist for a checklist item, create separate extracted entries for each value."
  - "Be thorough with items that commonly have multiple values: filings, dates, rulings, etc."
  - "Each extracted value should be self-contained and easy to read, so you can include important context if needed."
