  Dates_of_All_Decrees:
    description: "The decree-related dates, including entry dates, modification/amendment dates (of the order), suspension/stay dates, partial termination dates, and full termination/vacatur dates, for injunctions, consent decrees, and stipulated judgments/injunctions. If a settlement later becomes a court order (e.g., 'consent decree entered'), include the entry date of that order here (pre-entry settlement dates do not belong here). Do not include dates for non-decree items (e.g., private settlements not entered as orders). Extract each date as a separate value, formatted as: '[date]: [decree event].'"
