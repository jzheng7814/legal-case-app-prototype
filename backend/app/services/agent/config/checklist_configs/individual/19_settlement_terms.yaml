  Significant_Terms_of_Settlement:
    description: "The substantive obligations agreed to in a settlement that is not entered as a court order. Do not include any terms the court ordered (such as those in consent decrees or stipulated judgments/injunctions). A settlement may be court-approved or enforced, but as long as it is not entered as an order, it is a settlement. Extract each term as a separate value. If some terms are incorporated into an order, extract only the non-incorporated (purely contractual) terms."
