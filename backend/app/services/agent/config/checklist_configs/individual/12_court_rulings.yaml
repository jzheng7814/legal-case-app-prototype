  Court_Rulings:
    description: "The court's decisions or orders on key motions or issues, expressed as short, self-contained narrative values. Focus on how the court ruled on key motions or issues, such as: granted/denied motions to dismiss, granted/denied summary judgment, issued preliminary injunctions or TROs, certified/denied class certification, or made other significant procedural or substantive rulings. For each ruling, state what motion or issue the court decided, how it ruled (e.g., granted, denied, etc.), who brought the motion (if clear), and the relevant date(s) if available. Do not just restate document titles; instead, write each value so that a reader can understand what the court decided from that value alone. Extract each ruling as a separate value."
