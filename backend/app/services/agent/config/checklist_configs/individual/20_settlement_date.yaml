    description: "The settlement-related dates, including execution/signing date(s), court approval dates (if approved but not entered as an order), amendment dates, enforcement/retention dates without incorporation (e.g., when a court retains jurisdiction over the settlement but does not enter it as an order), and termination/expiration dates of the settlement agreement (if contractual). Do not include any date once the settlement (in whole or in part) is incorporated into a judgment or order. Extract each date as a separate value, formatted as: '[date]: [settlement event].'"
