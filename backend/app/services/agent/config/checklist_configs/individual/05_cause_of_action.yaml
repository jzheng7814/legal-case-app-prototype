  Cause_of_Action:
    description: "The legal vehicle(s) used to bring the claims—the 'how' of suing—such as statutes that create a private or enforcement right of action (e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the ADA, FTCA) or judge-made vehicles (e.g., Bivens). Do not include underlying rights (constitutional amendments or statutory rights), remedies (injunction, damages, declaratory relief), or procedural doctrines/rules (e.g., Rule 23, Ex parte Young, standing, immunity). Deduplicate repeats so that each cause of action appears only once."
