  Significant_Terms_of_Decrees:
    description: "The substantive obligations ordered by the court. This includes consent decrees and stipulated judgments/injunctions because they are entered as court orders. Do not include terms that appear only in a settlement agreement unless those terms are expressly incorporated into (and thus ordered by) the court. Extract each term as a separate value. If only part of a settlement is incorporated into an order, extract only the incorporated terms."
