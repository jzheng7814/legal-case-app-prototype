user_instruction: |
  Extract all 26 checklist items from the legal case documents as completely as possible. For each checklist item, extract ALL distinct pieces of information you find, not just the first or most prominent one. Each distinct value should be a separate item in the extracted list.

# Optional: Task-specific constraints beyond what's in the system prompt
# Leave empty ([]) if standard extraction rules apply
# Add constraints here only for special requirements specific to this task
constraints:
  - "Extract EVERY instance of each checklist item, not just the primary or most obvious one"
  - "When multiple values exist for a checklist item, create separate extracted entries for each value"
  - "Be thorough with items that commonly have multiple values: filings, dates, rulings, etc."
# Examples of additional constraints you might add:
#   - "Pay special attention to dates in footnotes"
#   - "Include dissenting opinions in the citation list"
#   - "For settlement terms, check both main text and exhibits"
